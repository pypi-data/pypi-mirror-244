O2

	license:
		This is literally what you need to breath.
		
		Don't let me place limitations on your 
		breathing and thus your immediate ability
		to survive.
		
		
	Description:
		
		This module is meant as a way of reserving
		the name "O2" for everyone's use in "private"
		python3 enterprizes. 
		
		There are zero plans to use this name
		for any purpose besides giving everyone
		a module name for use in "private" enterprizes.
		
		This reservation should prevent accidental 
		publishing to pypi and ensure that no 
		disrespect to other calculator builders
		occurs by using the same name for one 
		of your private enterprizes as the name of 
		a public pypi enterprize.
