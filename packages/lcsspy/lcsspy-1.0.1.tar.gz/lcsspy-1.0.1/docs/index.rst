Welcome to lcsspy's documentation!
==================================

**lcsspy** is a Python package to compute the longest common subsequence 
(also known as LCSS) similarity measure for time series data.

LCSS reconstructs a common subsequence by matching similar elements
in the two series. 
Two elements are matched if they are sufficiently close in time and
also have similar values.
