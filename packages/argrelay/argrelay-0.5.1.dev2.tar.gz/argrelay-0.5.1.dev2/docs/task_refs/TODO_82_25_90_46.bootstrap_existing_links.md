TODO_82_25_90_46: When there is already existing symlinks (e.g. pointing to some old `venv`), bootstrap does not override them (by `ln -sn`).

*   If `ln -snf` is used, it overwrites regular target file (not so save).
*   If `ln -sn` is used, it leaves already existing links.

Maybe just use `ln -snf`?
*   If file was there, it must have been under revision control anyway.
*   If it was a link, overwrite makes sense.
