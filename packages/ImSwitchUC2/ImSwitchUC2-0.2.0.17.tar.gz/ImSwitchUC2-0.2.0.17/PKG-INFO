# ImSwitch

[![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03394/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03394)

``ImSwitch`` is a software solution in Python that aims at generalizing microscope control by using an architecture based on the model-view-presenter (MVP) to provide a solution for flexible control of multiple microscope modalities.

## Statement of need

The constant development of novel microscopy methods with an increased number of dedicated
hardware devices poses significant challenges to software development.
ImSwitch is designed to be compatible with many different microscope modalities and customizable to the
specific design of individual custom-built microscopes, all while using the same software. We
would like to involve the community in further developing ImSwitch in this direction, believing
that it is possible to integrate current state-of-the-art solutions into one unified software.

## Installation

### Option A: Standalone bundles for Windows

Windows users can download ImSwitch in standalone format from the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch/releases). Further information is available there. An existing Python installation is *not* required.

In order to tart do the following:
Download the latest Artifact: https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch/actions/workflows/imswitch-bundle.yml
```
set SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib
ImSwitch.exe
```

### Option B: Install using pip

ImSwitch is also published on PyPI and can be installed using pip. Python 3.7 or later is required. Additionally, certain components (the image reconstruction module and support for TIS cameras) require the software to be running on Windows, but most of the functionality is available on other operating systems as well.

To install ImSwitch from PyPI, run the following command:

```
pip install ImSwitch
```

You will then be able to start ImSwitch with this command:

```
imswitch
```


### Option C: Install from Github (UC2 version)

**Installation**
```
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitch/
cd ImSwitch
# alternatively download this repo, unzip the .zip-file and open the command prompt in this directory
conda create -n imswitch python=3.9 -y
conda activate imswitch
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
#pip install -e ./
pip install -e . --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/bionanoimaging/nanoimagingpack

cd ~/Documents/
# if there is a folder called ImSwitchConfig => rename it!
git clone https://github.com/beniroquai/ImSwitchConfig
# Alternatively download the repository as a zip, unzip the file into the folder Documents/ImSwitchConfig
```

#### On Mac with ARM

On Mac (with M1 chip and on) open a terminal and enter `arch` to verify that your system-architecture is `arm64`. Now you have two options:

##### 1) Emulating Intel-chipset like behaviour

To emulate the used Intel-chipset like behaviour configure a [second terminal according to this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70217885/configure-m1-vscode-arm-but-with-a-rosetta-terminal). Once done, open this terminal, type `arch` again and verify that it is now emulating `i386`. Now you can continue the standard installation-procedure as given below.

```
brew install --cask mambaforge
mamba init
# open new shell
mamba create -n imswitch python=3.9

mamba install -c conda-forge napari

nano setup.cfg
# comment pypylon and QScintila and PyQtWebEngine and PyQT5
pip install --no-deps <LIB_NAME>
```

In the above code-snipped we suggest to use [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) which is a faster reimplementation of conda that still uses the same syntax and servers/packages. Make sure to have a look into the [documentation of mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and to check the [status of the brew-package](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/mambaforge) before installation. first Once all easily compatible packages are installed run `pip install --no-deps <LIB_NAME>` and replace `<LIB_NAME>` with the commented packages individually, so e.g. `pip install --no-deps pypylon` and so on.

##### 2) Working on arm64 chipset (e.g. Mac M1, M2 and on)

If you decided to stay with the native `arm64` chipset you will face various issues while trying to install a couple of libraries, because they are not build (and maintained) yet for arm64. Yet, with the necessary packages and recipies being available on conda-forge these packages can be simply build on the target machine (not only macOS, but e.g. Raspberry Pi or
Nano or ...). As opposed to the suggest global installation of prebuild packages using brew (e.g. in case of [PyQt5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65901162/how-can-i-run-pyqt5-on-my-mac-with-m1chip-ppc64el-architecture)) we suggest to keep everything in local environments for easy portability, reproduceability and traceability.

On example of the [QtScintilla package](https://pypi.org/project/QScintilla/) for PyQt5 we will demonstrate how to build the existing conda-recipe on your machine. First, try to install as many packages as possible along the [installation description above](#option-c-install-from-github-UC2-version).

In our case `mamba install -c conda-forge qt-main=5.15.6` did not succeed as somehow the downloading-pipe always broke and so the downloaded package was incomplete. Downloading the package by hand solved the problem. To find the package URL, first find out the correct package version (in our case `qt-main-5.15.6-hda43d4a_5.conda`) and then type `mamba search qt-main="5.15.6 hda43d4a_5" --info` in your terminal. You will find the url in the upfollowing list, here [https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-arm64/qt-main-5.15.6-hda43d4a_5.conda](https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-arm64/qt-main-5.15.6-hda43d4a_5.conda) with timestamp `2022-12-19 00:52:55 UTC`. Download it into your active environment's packages folder, which on default is `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/pkgs`.

As expected `pip install --no-deps QScintila` fails due to `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement QScintila (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for QScintila`.  Now clone the [conda feedstock of qscintilla2](https://github.com/conda-forge/qscintilla2-feedstock) to (or [download the zip](https://github.com/conda-forge/qscintilla2-feedstock/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it into) your `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/resources/` folder. Then run:

mamba activate imswitch
mamba install conda-build
cd /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/resources/qscintilla2/qscintilla2_recipe
mamba build --debug .
mamba install /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/envs/imswitch/conda-bld/osx-arm64/qscintilla2-2.13.3-py39h70deae4_4.tar.bz2

in case you built the package `qscintilla2-2.13.3-py39h70deae4_4.tar.bz2`. Et voil√†, you just build a package from a conda recipe for `macOS arm64`.  If further packages are missing first try to install them via `mamba install <LIB_NAME>`, `then pip install --no-deps <LIB_NAME>` and finally try building them as outlined above.

Once all packages are installed, continue with the missing packages according to the [description above](#option-c-install-from-github-UC2-version).

***DLL not found error***

In case you're working with the Daheng cameras, you may need to apply this patch:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58612306/how-to-fix-importerror-dll-load-failed-while-importing-win32api
