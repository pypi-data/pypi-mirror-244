Custom component that allows to import Kaggle datasets to Streamlit apps.

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is the world's largest data science community. It enables users to explore and analyze a wide variety of public datasets.
This app demonstrates a simple `KaggleDatasetConnection` which was built by extending the 
[built-in BaseConnection](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/connections/st.connections.experimentalbaseconnection)
You can view the connection source code
[here](https://github.com/arsentievalex/kaggle-streamlit-data-connector/blob/main/connection.py).

While Kaggle offers datasets in different formats, this connector ONLY supports CSV files.

A user can connect to a Kaggle dataset by providing the dataset path and filename.
The path is the part of the dataset URL after the domain name, the structure is following: username/dataset-name.
For example, for the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows, the path is `shivamb/netflix-shows`,
and the file name is `netflix_titles.csv`.

Using this example, the code to connect to the dataset would look like this:

```
from st_kaggle_connector import KaggleDatasetConnection
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("kaggle_datasets", type=KaggleDatasetConnection)
df = conn.get(path='shivamb/netflix-shows', filename='netflix_titles.csv', ttl=3600)
```

KaggleDatasetConnection` class assumes that you have secrets set up in the following format:

```
[connections.kaggle_datasets]
 KAGGLE_USERNAME = "insert your Kaggle username"
 KAGGLE_KEY = "insert your Kaggle API key"
```
