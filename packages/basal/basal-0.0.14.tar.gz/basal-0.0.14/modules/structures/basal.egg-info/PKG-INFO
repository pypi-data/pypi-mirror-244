	basal.JSON needs to be added to a folder:
		'''
		basal.JSON {
			"basilosauri": {
				"port": ""
			},
			"basal ganglia": {
				"path": ""
			},
			"PFC": {
				"path": ""
			}
		}

	#
	# This sets up the basal climate 
	import basal
	basal.start ()

	import basal.ganglia.list as basal_ganglia_list
	list = basal_ganglia_list.start ()




structure:
	archives
	
	sandbox:
		climate.py <- setup the basal db
		open.py <- uses basal
	
	modules_pip
		basal
			climate.JSON <- tinydb
		
	modules.pip.UTF8
