# CharLib: An open-source standard cell library characterizer

- üî© Supports combinational and sequential cells
- üìà Plots timing and I/O voltages
- üßë‚Äçüíª Easy-to-use, with YAML-based configuration
- üêç Implemented in Python 3 with a modified PySpice backend
- üå∂Ô∏è Compatible with ngspice and Xyce

## Introduction
CharLib is an open cell library characterizer originally based on [libretto](https://github.com/snishizawa/libretto). The current version supports timing characterization of combinational and sequential cells.

## Installation
CharLib can be installed from [PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/charlib) using pip:

```
# Install our customized version of PySpice
pip install git+https://github.com/infinitymdm/PySpice

# Install CharLib
pip install charlib
```
Make sure you also have a compatible circuit simulator. [ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/) and [xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/) are currently supported.

## Usage
`charlib path/to/library/config/`

CharLib searches the specified directory for a YAML file containing a valid cell library configuration, then characterizes the specified cells. See [yaml.md](https://github.com/stineje/CharLib/blob/main/docs/yaml.md) for information on constructing a config file.

The general process for using CharLib is as follows:
1. Acquire SPICE files and transistor models for the cells you want to characterize
2. Write a configuration YAML file for the library
3. Run CharLib
