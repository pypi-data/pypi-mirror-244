abstract = {STRIPACK is a Fortran 77 software package that employs an incremental algorithm to construct a Delaunay triangulation and, optionally, a Voronoi diagram of a set of points (nodes) on the surface of the unit sphere. The triangulation covers the convex hull of the nodes, which need not be the entire surface, while the Voronoi diagram covers the entire surface. The package provides a wide range of capabilities including an efficient means of updating the triangulation with nodal additions,or deletions. For N nodes, the storage requirement for the triangulation is 13N integer storage locations in addition to 3N nodal coordinates. Using an off-line algorithm and work space of size 3N, the triangulation can be constructed with time complexity O(NlogN).},

abstract = {TRIPACK is a Fortran 77 software package that employs an incremental algorithm to construct a constrained Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane (nodes). The triangulation covers the convex hull of the nodes but may include polygonal constraint regions whose triangles are distinguishable from those in the remainder of the triangulation. This effectively allows for a nonconvex or multiply connected triangulation (the complement of the union of constraint regions) while retaining the efficiency of searching and updating a convex triangulation. The package provides a wide range of capabilities including an efficient means of updating the triangulation with nodal additions or deletions. For N nodes, the storage requirement is 13N integer storage locations in addition to the 2N nodal coordinates.},

abstract = {SRFPACK is a Fortran 77 software package that constructs a smooth interpolatory or approximating surface to data values associated with arbitrarily distributed points in the plane. It employs automatically selected tension factors to preserve shape properties of the data and to avoid overshoot and undershoot associated with steep gradients. The domain of the fitting function may be nonconvex or multiply connected, and the surface may he constrained to have discontinuous value or derivative across a user-specified curve representing, for example, a geological fault line. Although triangle based, the method provides a means of avoiding the inaccuracy associated with long thin triangles on the boundary of the convex hull of the data abscissae.},
