# PyLMKit

**pylmkit** is a project aimed at building or integrating Large Model (LM) applications with practical value. It is designed to assist users in quickly constructing applications tailored to their own business needs.

## Quick Install
```bash
pip install -U pylmkit
```

## Functionality

- RolePlay：By setting up role templates and combining online search, memory, and knowledge base functionalities, we achieve typical conversational applications.Role-playing is a fundamental and essential feature in various major model enterprise apps. Nowadays, many underlying logics of functions such as `short video copywriting`, `Little Red Book copywriting`, and `emotionally intelligent circle of friends` are based on setting different role templates in role-playing.

- RAG：RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a method that utilizes knowledge base retrieval to provide content relevant to user queries, thereby enhancing the accuracy and specificity of the model's answers. RAG encompasses local knowledge bases, web-based knowledge bases, and database knowledge bases. Currently, pylmkit supports the rapid construction of local and web-based knowledge bases.

  **PyLMKit has designed four RAG functionalities**

  - DocRAG: Knowledge base based on local documents.
  - WebRAG: Knowledge base based on web pages.
  - DBRAG: Knowledge base based on databases.
  - MemoryRAG: Knowledge base based on memory.
