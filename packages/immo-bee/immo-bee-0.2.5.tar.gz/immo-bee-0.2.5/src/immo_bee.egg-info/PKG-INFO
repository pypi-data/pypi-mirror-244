# Immowelt Analyzer
Author: dirk.ulbricht@gmail.com

## Purpose
Scrape housing data from German housing portal Immowelt.de and retrieve as comma separted file.

## Installation

Note: This package depends on Geckodriver that can not be imported using pip. More information here: [Windows](https://github.com/dullibri/hauspreis_getting_ids.git) and for Linux it's `sudo apt install firefox-geckodriver` and for Mac use  `npm install geckodriver`. 

As long as this is still a test-version and being downloadable only from testpypi use:
```bash
python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ immo-bee
```

## Usage
### Commandline

```bash
 python -m immo_bee --help
 python -m immo_bee norderstedt hamburg
 ```
This will create a folder *data* on your current working directory (if it is not already there) and saves 4 json files for each location for houses, appartments, for rent and for sale respectively. Additionally it will create a comma separated file including all json files preprocessed and ready for usage.

### Import
If you prefer using immo_bee as a package use:
```python
from immo_bee import bee

list_of_locations = ["norderstedt","hamburg"]
df = bee(list_of_locations)
```
