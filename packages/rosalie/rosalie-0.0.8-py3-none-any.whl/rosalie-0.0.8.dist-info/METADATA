## Installation

The package is currently hosted on [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) and can be installed using:

```


## Developer workflow

- Published version lives on `main`.

## For the curious

In [Three Little Nuts for Cinderella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%99i_o%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%A1ky_pro_Popelku), "Rosalie" is Cinderella's wise pet owl that helps her make good choices; the hope is that this package does the same for its users.
