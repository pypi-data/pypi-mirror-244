Migrating to version 4.x
========================

The only change from 3.x to 4.x is that Tomcat 7 is no longer supported.
The Tomcat project `ended support <https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-70-eol.html>`_
for Tomcat 7 on 31 March 2021, and in early July 2021 the download and documentation
pages were removed from the website.

If you require Tomcat 7 support, use version 3.x.
