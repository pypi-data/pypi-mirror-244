Migrating to version 7.x
========================

Version 7.0 drops support for Python 3.7 and adds support for Python 3.12.

There is one new method in this release: :meth:`.TomcatManager.disconnect`.
Nothing else in the API has changed, so you won't have to update your code
to upgrade to this version.

The :doc:`tomcat-manager </interactive/tomcatmanager>` application
has many improvements, but none of them impact the API.
