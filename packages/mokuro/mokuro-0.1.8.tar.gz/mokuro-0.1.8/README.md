mokuro is aimed towards Japanese learners, who want to read manga in Japanese with a pop-up dictionary like [Yomichan](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan).
It works like this:
1. Perform text detection and OCR for each page.
2. After processing a whole volume, generate a HTML file, which you can open in a browser.
3. All processing is done offline (before reading). You can transfer the resulting HTML file together with manga images to
another device (e.g. your mobile phone) and read there.

mokuro uses [comic-text-detector](https://github.com/dmMaze/comic-text-detector) for text detection
and [manga-ocr](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr) for OCR.

Try running on your manga in Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kha-white/mokuro/blob/master/notebooks/mokuro_demo.ipynb)

# Installation

You need Python 3.6 or newer. Please note, that the newest Python release might not be supported due to a PyTorch dependency, which often breaks with new Python releases and needs some time to catch up.
Refer to [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for a list of supported Python versions.

Some users have reported problems with Python installed from Microsoft Store. If you see an error:
`ImportError: DLL load failed while importing fugashi: The specified module could not be found.`,
try installing Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads).

If you want to run with GPU, install PyTorch as described [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally),
otherwise this step can be skipped.

Run in command line:

```commandline
pip3 install mokuro
```

# Usage

## Run on one volume

```bash
mokuro /path/to/manga/vol1
```

This will generate `/path/to/manga/vol1.html` file, which you can open in a browser.

If your path contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes, like this:

```bash
mokuro "/path/to/manga/volume 1"
```

## Run on multiple volumes

```bash
mokuro /path/to/manga/vol1 /path/to/manga/vol2 /path/to/manga/vol3
```

For each volume, a separate HTML file will be generated.

## Run on a directory containing multiple volumes

If your directory structure looks somewhat like this:
```
manga_title/
├─vol1/
├─vol2/
├─vol3/
└─vol4/
```

You can process all volumes by running:

```bash
mokuro --parent_dir manga_title/
```

## Other options

```
--force_cpu - disable GPU
--as_one_file - generate separate css and js files instead of embedding everything in html
--disable_confirmation - run without asking for confirmation
```
