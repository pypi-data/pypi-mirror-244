## TLDR

This project downloads images from a Wiki that include human faces. Specifically, images that are associated with
certain wikipedia categories.

## Installation

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python%20-%2314354C.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch%20-%23EE4C2C.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white" />

Pip Installation Procedure:

#### From PIP:

```commandline
pip install wikifaces 
```

#### From Repo:

```commandline
git clone git@github.com:tford9/Wiki-Faces-Downloader.git
cd Wiki-Faces-Downloader
python setup.py
pip install wikifaces
```

## Usage

#### Command-Line Example

```commandline
python downloader -i "indonesian engineers" -o ../data/ -d
```

#### Package Example

```python
from wikifaces.downloader import WikiFace

wikiface_obj = WikiFace()
wikiface_obj.download(categories=['facebook'], depth=2, output_location='../data/')
```

The following structure is output:

- `facebook`
    - `cached_1_people_pages_d2.pkl`
    - `cached_pages_d2.pkl`
    - `alan_rushbridger`
        - `Alan_Rusbridger_01.jpg-p0.jpg`
    - `...`
    - `mark_zuckerberg`
        - `MarkZuckerbergcrop.jpg-p1.jpg`
    - `...`

The process is carried out as follows:

1. Given a category from a Wiki, collect *n* pages that contain the same category as well as at least one category
   containing "people" in the title.
2. With those pages, crawl across their included categories and collect *y* pages that contain those categories as well
   as at least one "people" category.
3. Given the collected Wiki pages, download the primary image from the page and determine if it is a human face using
   light facial detection.
4. We capture all images from the wiki that contain the name of the page (if it's a person then the filename contains
   their name),
5. Using the captured name and images, we create a dataset for that face.

TODOs:

1. Currently, a part of this process uses a recursive call structure to get all related pages; there may be a way to
   linearize, or parallelize this.
2. Currently, we are only pulling images contain the person's name in the title and only have one visible face in the
   image. All other images are not considered. A voting system should be added to get the most represented faces across
   multiple images.
