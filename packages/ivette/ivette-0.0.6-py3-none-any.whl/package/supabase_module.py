    Download a file from a remote storage bucket and save it locally.

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file to be downloaded.
        dir (str, optional): The local directory where the file will be saved (default is 'pyDir').
        bucketDir (str, optional): The directory in the storage bucket where the file is located (default is 'JobQueue/').

    Returns:
        None

    Note:
    - This function is designed to download a file from a remote storage bucket (e.g., Supabase) and save it locally.
    - The 'filename' argument specifies the name of the file to be downloaded.
    - The 'dir' argument (defaulting to 'tmp/') specifies the local directory where the downloaded file will be saved.
    - The 'bucketDir' argument (defaulting to 'JobQueue/') specifies the directory in the remote storage bucket where
      the file is located.
    - The function constructs the full local path and downloads the file, saving it locally in binary mode ('wb+').
    - Make sure to have the appropriate access and credentials to access the remote storage bucket.

    Example Usage:
    downloadApi('example_file', dir='myLocalDir/', bucketDir='CustomBucket/')

    Details:
    - This function is used to download files from a remote storage bucket and is often used to retrieve files for
      local processing.
    - The 'dir' argument allows you to specify a different local directory where the downloaded file should be saved.
    - The 'bucketDir' argument allows you to specify a different directory within the storage bucket where the file
      is located.

    - The 'bucketName' argument (defaulting to 'ivette-bucket') specifies the name of the remote storage bucket.
    - The 'localDir' argument (defaulting to 'tmp/') specifies the local directory where the file is located.
    - The function reads the local file, creates a path in the remote storage bucket, and uploads the file.

    Example Usage:

    Details:
    - This function is often used to upload files to remote storage for sharing, archiving, or processing.
    - The 'bucketName' and 'localDir' arguments allow you to specify the target storage bucket and local file directory.
    - The 'bucketPath' is constructed using 'bucketDir' and 'id' to specify the exact location within the storage bucket.
