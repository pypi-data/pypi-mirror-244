    """Create an individual from a tree grown with Nicolau's "PTC2".

    The original PTC2 method for growing random trees was invented by
    Sean Luke in 2000. Some slightly modified variants were
    introduced later by other authors.
    This function implements a PTC2 variant described by Miguel Nicolau
    in 2017 in section "3.3 Probabilistic tree-creation 2 (PTC2)" of
    the publication. It restricts tree size not with a maximum tree
    depth but rather with a maximum number of expansions and if
    possible remains strictly below this limit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grammar : `~alogos.Grammar`
    parameters : `dict` or `~alogos._utilities.parametrization.ParameterCollection`, optional
        Following keyword-value pairs are considered by this function:

        - ``init_ind_ptc2_max_expansions`` (`int`): The maximum number
          of nonterminal expansions that may be used to grow the tree.

    Raises
    ------
    InitializationError
        If the initialization of the individual fails.

    Notes
    -----
    The leaf nodes of the derivation tree are read to create the
    phenotype.
    The phenotype is converted to a genotype with
    the `~.mapping.reverse` mapping function of this system.

          provide probabilities of appearance of functions in the tree,
          plus a desired expected tree size, and guarantees that, on
          average, trees will be of that size."

        - "With PTC2, the user provides a probability distribution of
          requested tree sizes. PTC2 guarantees that, once it has picked
          a random tree size from this distribution, it will generate
          and return a tree of that size or slightly larger."
