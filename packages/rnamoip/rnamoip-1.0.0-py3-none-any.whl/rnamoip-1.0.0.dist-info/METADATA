# RNAMoIP

## Setup

RNAMoIP can be installed via Pypi with the following command:

```bash
pip install rnamoip
```

You will also need ViennaRNA installed locally:

```bash
wget https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/download/sourcecode/2_6_x/ViennaRNA-2.6.4.tar.gz
tar -zxvf ViennaRNA-2.6.4.tar.gz

cd ViennaRNA-2.6.4
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Python Environment (Optional)

Use your favorite virtual environment for Python. The python [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) module is recommended if you don't have any.

To create a Python version with `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv rnamoip-env
```

Afterward, you can use that environment with the following command:

```bash
source rnamoip-env/bin/activate
```

### Python dependencies

To install the Python dependencies, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Python bindings are already provided in the requirements file. Please note that RNAMoIP was built using ViennaRNA `v2.6.4`. For more information, check for the [ViennaRNA Documentation](https://github.com/ViennaRNA/ViennaRNA#installation).

### IP Model Solver

Multiple solvers are supported to solve the RNAMoIP equations.

#### CP-SAT (Recommended)

Cp-SAT is a free, open-source IP solver from the OR-tools Package, made by Google. For more information, visit their GitHub [here](https://github.com/google/or-tools).

#### CBC

CBC (Coin-or branch and cut) is a free, open-source IP solver available [here](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc). It can be useful as an alternative to Gurobi, although considerably slower. It is automatically provided by the MIP python library for 64-bits Intel architecture. For more details, like manual installation, please refer to the [MIP doc](https://docs.python-mip.com/en/latest/install.html#using-your-own-cbc-binaries-optional).

#### Gurobi (Need License)

To install, follow the directives [here](https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/). Note that a [free academic license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/) can be used for a renewable two months period.

## How to execute

To execute RNAMoIP, you can run the `main.py` with the following command:

```bash
cd src
python -m rnamoip.main --sequence "AAGGUUCC" --structure "........"
```

You can also provide a more detailed configuration file. By default, it will use the base configuration located in `src/data/configuration.json`.
You can also run the prediction through the `Prediction` Python class:

```py
# From agrs
from rnamoip.predicter import Predicter

Predicter(
  rna_sequence='AAGGUUCC',
  secondary_structure='........',
  alpha=0.1,
).iterate()

# With a config file path or dict
Predicter(configuration_file='my/path/to/configuration.json').iterate()
```

For more use cases, with **configurations details**, please see the [**Usage Documentation**](doc/usage.md).

## Motif Databases

RNAMoIP support two types of motif databases:

- (**default**) The RIN database, of parser of type `rin`. RNAMoIP already provide a rins database of all local rins.
- The original RNAMoIP database, of parser of type `desc`, available [here](https://github.com/McGill-CSB/RNAMoIP/raw/master/CATALOGUE.tgz).

You need to specify the path of the motif database accordingly in the `motifs_path` property, and the motif type with the `parser` property. For more info, see the [**Usage Documentation**](doc/usage.md).

## Scripts

Useful scripts related to the project can be found under the [scripts folder](scripts/_scripts.md).

## Benchmark

To run a batch of multiple prediction RNAMoIP, with all chains that what used in the benchmark:

```py
python -m rnamoip.multi_batch_analysis --chains_source="../data/chain/chains.json"
```
