The `flaxkv` module provides a dictionary-like interface for interacting with high-performance key-value databases (LMDB, LevelDB).
It abstracts the complexities of direct database interaction, allowing users to perform CRUD operations in a simple and 
intuitive manner. You can use it just like a Python dictionary without worrying about it blocking your main process at any stage.

**Use Cases**

- **Key-Value Structure**: `flaxkv` is suitable for storing simple key-value structured datasets.
 
- **High-Frequency Writing**: `flaxkv` is very suitable for scenarios that require high-frequency insertion/updating of data.
  
- **Machine Learning**: `flaxkv` is perfect for storing various embeddings, images, texts, and other large datasets with key-value structures in machine learning.

---

## Key Features

- **Always Up-to-date, Never Blocking**: It was designed from the ground up to ensure that no write operations block the user process, while users can always read the most recently written data.

- **Ease of Use**: Interacting with the database feels just like using a Python dictionary! You don't even have to worry about resource release.

- **Buffered Writing**: Data is buffered and scheduled for write to the database, reducing the overhead of frequent database writes.

- **High-Performance Database Backend**: Uses the high-performance key-value database LMDB as its default backend.

- **Atomic Operations**: Ensures that write operations are atomic, safeguarding data integrity.

- **Thread-Safety**: Employs only necessary locks to ensure safe concurrent access while balancing performance.

## TODO

- [x] Client-Server Architecture
- [ ] Benchmark

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install flaxkv
```
### Usage

```python
from flaxkv import dictdb
import numpy as np

db = dictdb('./test_db')
# or run server `flaxkv run --port 8000`, then:
# db = dictdb('http://localhost:8000', remote=True)

db[1] = 1
db[1.1] = 1 / 3
db['key'] = 'value'
db['a dict'] = {'a': 1, 'b': [1, 2, 3]}
db['a list'] = [1, 2, 3, {'a': 1}]
db[(1, 2, 3)] = [1, 2, 3]
db['numpy array'] = np.random.randn(100, 100)

db.setdefault('key', 'value_2')
assert db['key'] == 'value'

db.update({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})

assert 'key2' in db

db.pop("key1")
assert 'key1' not in db

for key, value in db.items():
    print(key, value)

print(len(db))
```

You might have noticed that even when the program ends, we didn't use `db.close()` to release resources! 
Everything will be handled automatically.
More importantly, as a persistent database, it offers performance close to dictionary (in-memory) access!
(There should be a benchmark here.)

P.S.: Of course, you can also manually call `db.close()` to release resources immediately.
