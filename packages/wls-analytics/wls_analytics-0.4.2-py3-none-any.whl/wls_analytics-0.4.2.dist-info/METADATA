# $ wls-analytics

**Advanced Log Analysis for WebLogic Server Clusters**

In the landscape of clustered WebLogic servers, managing and analyzing logs can pose a significant challenge. wls-analytics is a command-line tool that enables you to analyze logs from multiple WebLogic servers and domains. It is designed to be used by administrators and engineers who need to quickly identify and resolve issues in clustered WebLogic environments.

wls-analytics offers a range of features tailored to the complexities of clustered WebLogic servers. It enables administrators and engineers to dissect logs within specific time intervals, construct efficient index files, and apply customizable patterns for data categorization.

## Installation

You can install wls-analytics from PyPI as follows.

```bash
$ pip install wls-analytics
```

When you want to install from source, after you clone the repository, you can build the module as follows. 

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
$ make build 
```

The module package will be created under the `dist` directory. You can then install it as follows.

```bash
pip install dist/wls_analytics-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
```

Please change the version of the module accordingly.

Run `wlsanalytics --help` for details how to use the tool. 

## Features

There is a command to analyze SOA out logs. You can use it as follows. 

Set the home directory of the tool in the `WLSA_HOME` environment variable.

```bash
$ export WLSA_HOME=/path/to/wls-analytics
   ```

Create the configuration file in `$WLSA_HOME/config/config.yaml` and define the sets of log files the tool should analyze. Please check [`config/config.yaml`](https://github.com/tomvit/wls-analytics/blob/main/config/config.yaml) for the sample configuration file.

In the same configuration file, define the patterns to be searched in logs. There is already a number of patterns defined in the file. You can add your own patterns as well.

Define the location of the configuration file in the `WLSA_CONFIG` environment variable. Alternatively, you can provide the path to the configuration file as an argument to the command.

```bash
$ export WLSA_CONFIG=$WLSA_HOME/config/config.yaml
```

Run the command to analyze the set of log files called `o2c`. The set must be defined in the configuration file.

```bash
$ wlsanalytics soa error o2c --from "2023-09-19 11:06:39" --to "2023-09-19 12:06:39"
```

There are various configuration options you can use. Run `wlsanalytics soa error --help` for details.

As a result, you will get the following output:

```bash
-- Time range: 2023-09-19 11:06:39 - 2023-09-19 12:06:39
-- Searching files in the set 'o2c'

-- Completed in 9.43s

...
```
    
When you use the index option `--index`, there will be an index created for the output. You can then use to explore log entries that belong to specifc error by using the index value.    

```bash
wlsanalytics soa index tevu
```

This will open the `less` viewer on your local computer with the entries that belong to the error with the index value `tevu`.
