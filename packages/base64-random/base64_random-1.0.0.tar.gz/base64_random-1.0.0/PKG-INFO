# base64_random

Generates a base 64 random number of an arbitrary length.

base64_random uses Python's `secrets` module to generate the random numbers, so you should be able to generate high
quality random numbers when using this library. That said, I cannot recommend that this library be used in contexts 
where high-quality random numbers are used to secure sensitive information. Please use a suitable cryptography library
for contexts where you need to protect information.

Please also note, that as of the time of writing, this library provides **NO SUPPORT** for Base64 encoding or decoding.
Additionally, this library generates numbers in base 64, it has no relation to the 
[Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding format.

## Usage
There are two main ways to use this package, command line invocation and importing the module. 

### Command Line Invocation
Command line usage is quite easy, simply pass the module the length of number you wish to generate:

```shell
python -m base64_random 10
```
Or, by invoking the shell script:
```shell
b64r 10
```

### Python module usage
You can also import this module in your code to use it:

```python
from base64_random import gen_random_base64

base64_number = gen_random_base64(10)

print(base64_number)
```

## Installation
`base64_random` is available on pip!

```shell
pip install base64_random
```

You can also install `base64_random` directly from git, but please refer to the 
[official documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/#install-a-package-from-github) for the details
of how to do that.
