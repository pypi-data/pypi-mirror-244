# Welcome to Jupyter-TinCan!

In the realm of data science and software development, safeguarding sensitive information is paramount. Traditional approaches, such as using remote desktop interfaces to access Jupyter notebooks, offer security but at a cost to user experience. These methods typically involve a cumbersome 'browser within a browser' setup, leading to ergonomic challenges like conflicting keyboard shortcuts, noticeable latency, and a disconnect from local development tools like VSCode. Often, developers find themselves forced into less efficient workflows, such as committing code remotely instead of locally.

Jupyter-TinCan changes the game by offering a simpler, more intuitive solution. It transforms sensitive text in notebook cells into images, maintaining data security while enhancing user experience. No more cumbersome setups or workflow disruptions – just smooth, secure, and efficient development.

## Installation

## Usage

You can configure any pre-existing Jupyter kernel to use Jupyter-TinCan. First let's list the kernels we have installed:

```console
$ jupyter kernelspec list
Available kernels:
  python3    /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3
```

Now let's put the python3 kernel into TinCan mode:

```console
$ mkdir python3-tincan
$ jupyter tincan create-kernel /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 > python3-tincan/kernel.json
```

This will create a new kernel spec file called `tincan-python3.json` in the current directory. You can now install this kernel spec into Jupyter:

```console
$ jupyter kernelspec install python3-tincan
```

or

```console
$ jupyter kernelspec install --user python3-tincan
```
