## About The Project

Uploading stuff to usenet is tedious so I tried to make it easier.

* Searches subdirectories for defined file extensions in `juicenet.yaml` or as passed in `--exts`
* Alternatively, searches for glob patterns passed in `--pattern`
* Provides basic BDMV support
* Creates par2 files
* Directly passes files and corresponding .par2 files to Nyuu
* Offers the option to organize files into separate folders for manual upload
* Automatically checks for and reposts raw articles on each run
* Can **NOT** continue from where it stopped if it gets interrupted for any reason
* Probably has cases where it breaks. Feel free to open an issue if you find any
* Tried to keep it OS independent but I've mostly tested this on Windows

## Getting Started

This script uses ParPar for generating the PAR2 recovery files and Nyuu for uploading to usenet.

### Prerequisites

* [Python >=3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [animetosho/Nyuu](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu) - You need version [`a4b1712`](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/commit/a4b1712d77faeacaae114c966c238773acc534fb) or newer. [v0.4.1 is outdated and you shouldn't use it](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
  * Until animetosho uploads a new release, you can grab the [Windows binary here](https://github.com/Ravencentric/Nyuu/releases/latest)
* [animetosho/ParPar](https://github.com/animetosho/ParPar)

### Installation

1. With [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/) (recommended):

    ```sh
    pipx install juicenet-cli
    ```

2. With pip:

    ```sh
    pip install juicenet-cli
    ```

3. From source with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):
    > **Note**: The `main` branch is not stable and maybe broken. Use this method if you know what you're doing. Stable (mostly) builds can be found in [releases](https://github.com/Ravencentric/juicenet-cli/releases) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/juicenet-cli/)

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ravencentric/juicenet-cli.git
    ```

    ```sh
    cd juicenet-cli
    ```

    Run:

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

    ```sh
    poetry shell
    ```

    ```sh
    python -m juicenet --help
    ```

    Build:

    ```sh
    poetry build
    ```

## Usage

Before you can use this, you'll have to fill out [`juicenet.yaml`](https://github.com/Ravencentric/juicenet-cli/blob/main/config/juicenet.yaml). After you've specified all the values in the config you just have to pass it to juicenet-cli. You can do that in one of three ways:

1. Using the command-line argument: `--config <path>`
2. Setting an environment variable named `JUICENET_CONFIG`
3. Placing the configuration file in the current working directory as `juicenet.yaml`

The order of precedence, if all three are present, is:
`command-line argument > environment variable > local file in the current working directory`

The above was the first time setup, after which you can simply run:

```sh
juicenet "path\to\directory\with\files"
```
