## About The Project

Uploading stuff to usenet is tedious so I tried to make it easier.

* Uses [ParPar](https://github.com/animetosho/ParPar) and [Nyuu](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu) under the hood
* Recursively searches for files with pre-defined extensions in `juicenet.yaml` or as passed in `--exts`
* Alternatively, searches for glob patterns passed in `--pattern`
* Preserves folder structure without RAR. [RAR sucks and here's why](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/wiki/Stop-RAR-Uploads)
* Does everything automatically and gives you the resulting `nzbs` in a neatly sorted manner
* Offers the option to pick and choose what it does if you don't want it doing everything automatically
* Automatically checks for and reposts failed articles from last run. Also has the option to not do this.
* Can **NOT** continue from where it stopped if it gets interrupted for any reason

## Getting Started

`juicenet-cli` is built with Python and uses Nyuu and ParPar under the hood.

### Prerequisites

* [Python >=3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Nyuu](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu) - You need version [`a4b1712`](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/commit/a4b1712d77faeacaae114c966c238773acc534fb) or newer. [v0.4.1 is outdated and you shouldn't use it](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
  * Until animetosho uploads a new release, you can grab the [Windows binary here](https://github.com/Ravencentric/Nyuu/releases/latest)
* [ParPar](https://github.com/animetosho/ParPar)
