    -----
    This function returns a string representation of a table that shows the differences between two dictionaries.
    It compares the keys of the dictionaries, and for each key present in either dictionary, it displays the
    corresponding values side by side, highlighting any differences. If a key is present in one dictionary but not
    the other, the corresponding value is replaced with "<<MISSING>>" in the table.
