def run_tests(test_file, module_name, pytest_args=None, *, coverage: bool = True):
    """Run tests on given file.

    Examples
    --------
    This function is typically included at the bottom of `test_<myfile>.py`.

    .. code-block: python

            from pygim.utils import run_tests

    Notes
    -----
    When coverage is enabled, debugging the actual code is not possible, as the module
    must be reloaded before execution to ensure coverage for the module is captured.
    This can remove breakpoints assigned from the IDE.

    Parameters
    ----------
    test_file : `str` or `pathlib.Path`
        Path to file to be tested.
    module_name : `str`
        Name of the module used for coverage. Usually works by passing object.__class__.__module__.
    pytest_args : `tuple`, optional
        Any arguments needed to be passed for pytest. (the default is None, which means default
        argument set is given).
    coverage : `bool`, optional
        Runs the coverage. (the default is True, which runs the coverage).
