# SUMO - CommonRoad Interface

This package implements the interface between the framework for motion planning of automated vehicles [commonroad-io](https://pypi.org/project/commonroad-io/)
and the traffic simulator [SUMO](https://sumo.dlr.de).
The interface is presented in detail in our [paper](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1486856/344641.pdf) [1].

## Documentation

Please refer to the [documentation](https://cps.pages.gitlab.lrz.de/sumo-interface/) and [tutorials](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/sumo-interface).
