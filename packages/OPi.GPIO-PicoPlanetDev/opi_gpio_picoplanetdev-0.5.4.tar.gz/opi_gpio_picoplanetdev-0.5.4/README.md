# OPi.GPIO

**My attempt at maintaining OPi.GPIO for at least the Orange Pi Zero 3**

A drop-in replacement library for RPi.GPIO for the Orange Pi Zero and other SBCs.
Only the basic GPIO functions are replicated, using sysfs: this allows the GPIO pins to be accessed from user space.

See the [documentation](https://opi-gpio.readthedocs.io) for install instructions and detailed API usage.
*Note: this documentation is not specific to this fork.*
