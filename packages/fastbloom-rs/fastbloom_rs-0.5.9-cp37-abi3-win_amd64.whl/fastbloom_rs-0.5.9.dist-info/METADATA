	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

# Examples

## BloomFilter

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard
Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive
matches are possible, but false negatives are not.

**Reference**: Bloom, B. H. (1970). Space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors.
Communications of the ACM, 13(7), 422-426.
[Full text article](http://crystal.uta.edu/~mcguigan/cse6350/papers/Bloom.pdf)

### Python

basic usage

```python
from fastbloom_rs import BloomFilter

bloom = BloomFilter(100_000_000, 0.01)

bloom.add_str('hello')
bloom.add_bytes(b'world')
bloom.add_int(9527)

assert bloom.contains('hello')
assert bloom.contains(b'world')
assert bloom.contains(9527)

assert not bloom.contains('hello world')
```

build bloom filter from bytes or list

```python
from fastbloom_rs import BloomFilter

bloom = BloomFilter(100_000_000, 0.01)
bloom.add_str('hello')
assert bloom.contains('hello')

bloom2 = BloomFilter.from_bytes(bloom.get_bytes(), bloom.hashes())
assert bloom2.contains('hello')

bloom3 = BloomFilter.from_int_array(bloom.get_int_array(), bloom.hashes())
assert bloom3.contains('hello')

```

there are some bulk api for python to reduce ffi cost between python and rust

```python
bloom = BloomFilter(100_000_000, 0.01)
inserts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 18, 68, 90, 100]
checks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 18, 68, 90, 100, 190, 290, 390]
results = [True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, False, False, False]

bloom.add_int_batch(inserts)
contains = bloom.contains_int_batch(checks)
assert contains == results

bloom.add_str_batch(list(map(lambda x: str(x), inserts)))
assert bloom.contains_str_batch(list(map(lambda x: str(x), checks))) == results

bloom.add_bytes_batch(list(map(lambda x: bytes(x), inserts)))
assert bloom.contains_bytes_batch(list(map(lambda x: bytes(x), checks))) == results
```

more examples at [py_tests](py_tests/test_bloom.py).

### Rust

```rust
use fastbloom_rs::{BloomFilter, FilterBuilder};

let mut bloom = FilterBuilder::new(100_000_000, 0.01).build_bloom_filter();

bloom.add(b"helloworld");
assert_eq!(bloom.contains(b"helloworld"), true);
assert_eq!(bloom.contains(b"helloworld!"), false);
```

more examples at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/fastbloom-rs)

## CountingBloomFilter

A Counting Bloom filter works in a similar manner as a regular Bloom filter; however, it is
able to keep track of insertions and deletions. In a counting Bloom filter, each entry in the
Bloom filter is a small counter associated with a basic Bloom filter bit.

**Reference**: F. Bonomi, M. Mitzenmacher, R. Panigrahy, S. Singh, and G. Varghese, “An Improved
Construction for Counting Bloom Filters,” in 14th Annual European Symposium on
Algorithms, LNCS 4168, 2006

### Python

```python
from fastbloom_rs import CountingBloomFilter

cbf = CountingBloomFilter(1000_000, 0.01)
cbf.add('hello')
cbf.add('hello')
assert 'hello' in cbf
cbf.remove('hello')
assert 'hello' in cbf  # because 'hello' added twice. 
# If add same element larger than 15 times, then remove 15 times the filter will not contain the element.
cbf.remove('hello')
assert 'hello' not in cbf
```

A CountingBloomFilter has a four bits counter to save hash index, so when insert an
element repeatedly, the counter will spill over quickly. So, you can set
`enable_repeat_insert` to `False` to check whether the element has added.
if it has added, it will not add again. `enable_repeat_insert` default set to `True`.

```python
from fastbloom_rs import CountingBloomFilter

cbf = CountingBloomFilter(1000_000, 0.01, False)
cbf.add('hello')
cbf.add('hello')  # because enable_repeat_insert=False, this addition will not take effect. 
assert 'hello' in cbf
cbf.remove('hello')
assert 'hello' not in cbf 
```

more examples at [py_tests](py_tests/test_counting_bloom_filter.py).

### Rust

```rust
use fastbloom_rs::{CountingBloomFilter, FilterBuilder};

let mut builder = FilterBuilder::new(100_000, 0.01);
let mut cbf = builder.build_counting_bloom_filter();
cbf.add(b"helloworld");
assert_eq!(bloom.contains(b"helloworld"), true);
```
