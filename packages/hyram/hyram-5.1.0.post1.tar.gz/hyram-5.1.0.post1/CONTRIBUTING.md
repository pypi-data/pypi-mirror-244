# HyRAM+ Python Package Development

The Hydrogen Plus Other Alternative Fuels Risk Assessment Models (HyRAM+) Python package contains modules for the calculation of physical release and risk for alternative fuels.
The Python modules within this package can be modified for a variety of reasons, such as to fix an error or add a new capability.


# Installation for Development

The complete HyRAM+ package source code can be cloned from: https://github.com/sandialabs/hyram

The standalone Python package source code can also be downloaded from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hyram/#files) or from [Conda-Forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hyram/files).

It is recommended to install the HyRAM+ source code to your Python environment as a symbolic link for modifications/development.
This way, when local modifications are made, there is no need to reinstall the Python package.
This is especially useful with the `%load_ext autoreload` and `%autorelaod 2` commands in iPython/Jupyter Notebooks.

To install as a symbolic link, use this command in this directory (`./src/hyram`):

~~~~ 
pip install -e .

# Testing

This package includes a suite of automated tests using the Python `unittest` framework, located here under the `tests` folder. These include standard unit tests for the physics and qra modules as well as validation tests.

These tests may be executed either by running the `runner.py` file in that directory, or by utilizing the Python `unittest` framework to discover tests.

All tests will be located in this "tests" directory and will match the pattern: `test_*.py`.

Contributors are encouraged to create or modify tests based on the changes being made to the source code.
Any new or modified tests should be discoverable by `unittest` (see [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)), and should be incorporated into the `runner.py` file.

The expectation is that code committed to the repository should pass all tests in this directory.

# Changelog

For any significant changes made to the source code, it is expected that the change will be summarized in the [CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md) document located in the top-level directory.
Guidance and suggestions for how to best enter these changes in the changelog are [here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
New changes should be added to the `[Unreleased]` section at the top of the file; these will be moved to a release section during the next public release.
