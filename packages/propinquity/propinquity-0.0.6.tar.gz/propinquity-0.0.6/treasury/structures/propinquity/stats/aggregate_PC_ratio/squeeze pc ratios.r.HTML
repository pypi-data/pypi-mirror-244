	description:
		This calculates the sum of every call option for a symbol 
		or "symbol and expiration".
		
		It also calculates the sum of every put option for a symbol 
		or "symbol and expiration".
		
		The it calculates the ratio of the call sums to the put sums.
		
		

	FOR EACH CONTRACT:
	sumMATION (CONTRACT PRICE * open interest * SHARES PER CONTRACT) 


	âˆ‘ (CONTRACT PRICE * open interest * SHARES PER CONTRACT) 
	
	code:
		import propinquity.STATS.AGGREGATE_PC_RATIO as AGGREGATE_PC_RATIO
		evaluation = AGGREGATE_PC_RATIO.calc (EXAMPLE_1)

	plan:
		calculates the sum and ratios of:

		for one expiration:
			summation (ask value of every call) : summation (ask value of every put)
			summation (bid value of every call) : summation (bid value of every put)
			summation (last value of every call) : summation (last value of every put)
		
		for every expiration:
			summation (ask value of every call) : summation (ask value of every put)
			summation (bid value of every call) : summation (bid value of every put)
			summation (last value of every call) : summation (last value of every put)
