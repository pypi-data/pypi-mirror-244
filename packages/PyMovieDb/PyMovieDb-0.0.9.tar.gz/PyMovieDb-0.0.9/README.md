## Documentation 

**_NOTE: The API will return data as JSON not dict_**

**1) Getting a Movie/Tv-Series info :-**

Use ``` get_by_name(<name>, tv=False) ``` method to get information of a movie/TV-Series.

The ``` tv ``` is an optional argument, if ``` tv=True``` it will get data from ```TV Series``` files only.

On the other hand, if ```tv=False``` (default), it will find your file in ```Movies + TV Series``` results

    "reviewBody": "New TV series streaming from Amazon, my wife and I watched two episodes on each of four successive nights. Sort of like movie nights. This is not high art, the writing has lots of humor, in real life Reacher couldn&apos;t get away with everything depicted. BUT ... it is a very entertaining series. Especially for those of us who enjoy seeing a smart, mild-mannered, well-spoken, well-trained, big tough guy put the bad guys in their places. Some simple thugs, some unruly prison inmates, some dirty cops. Ritchson is a r real good pick for the role. (In an interview he said he gained 30 pounds for the role.)\n\nReacher is an ex-military man, he takes a bus to the small Georgia town, walks to town to look up an old blues singer&apos;s home, immediately gets arrested for murder, but eventually works with local law enforcement to help solve the mysteries, and there are several.\n\nMost episodes are roughly 45 to 50 minutes long, set in a fictional Georgia town not far from Atlanta. Cast and characters are interesting. The story is not too deep but surprisingly interesting, just good entertainment. Streaming on Amazon.",

    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll admit i&apos;ve skewed my rating a bit, i&apos;ve ranked it so highly rated based on the fact I knew what movie I was buying a ticket for. I&apos;m not rating it highly because it&apos;s a modern classic, i&apos;m doing it based on wanting to see a funny and entertaining action movie and in that respect it delivers pretty much everything I went to the cinema for.\n\nThe premise of the film is basic, the cast is solid, the characters are excellent including mini side characters. The humour has a few misses but generally it is a pretty funny movie throughout, they also pay off everything that is set up along the way which makes it a satisfying watch. Also if you are yet to see it, stay through the credits as it does tie up one or two of those loose ends.\n\nThe slight downside for me, were that the run time does sag a little toward the end but it is over 2 hours long and otherwise moved along at a steady rate.",
