# Creating UERD test images in Matlab

As reference, we use the [Matlab simulation](https://codeocean.com/capsule/7800700/tree/v4) from Remi Cogranne.

We slightly modified the code such that the user can provide a seed to the random number generator. The array of random numbers is transposed in order to match the Python implementation. You can find the updated code in `uerd.m`.
