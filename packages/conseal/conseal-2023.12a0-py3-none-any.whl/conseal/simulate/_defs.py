    Calculate probability of embedding into each DCT coefficient location.
    This probability follows the Boltzmann distribution, also called Gibbs distribution.

    p_i = Pr(Y_i = y_i) = 1 / Z * exp( -lambda D(X, y_i X_~i )

    where
        x_i is the original value at the i-th position,
        y_i = argmin_{z in {x_i - 1, x_i + 1}} D(X, zX_~i) is the modified value at the i-th position,
        Z is a normalization factor,
        y_i X_~i denotes the cover image whose i-th value has been modified to Y_i = y_i and all other pixels remain unchanged, and
        lambda is a constant.
