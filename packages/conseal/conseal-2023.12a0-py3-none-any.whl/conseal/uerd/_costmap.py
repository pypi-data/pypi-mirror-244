"""Implementation of UERD steganographic embedding.

"Using Statistical Image Model for JPEG Steganography: Uniform Embedding Revisited,"
IEEE TIFS 2015. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7225122

The idea of uniform embedding distortion (UED) is to spread the changes
across all the DCT coefficients (including the DC, zero and non-zero AC coefficients).

The uniform embedding revisited distortion (UERD) incorporates
the complexity of the specific DCT block and the specific DCT mode.
