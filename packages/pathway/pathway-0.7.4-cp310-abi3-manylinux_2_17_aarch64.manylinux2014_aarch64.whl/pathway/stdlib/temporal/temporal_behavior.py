        delay:
            Optional; for windows, delays initial output by ``delay`` with respect to the

            delaying mechanism.

            For interval joins, it delays the time the record is joined by ``delay``.

            Using `delay` is useful when updates are too frequent.
        cutoff:
            Optional; for windows, stops updating windows which end earlier than maximal
            seen time minus ``cutoff``. Setting cutoff to ``None`` does not enable
            cutoff mechanism.

            For interval joins, it ignores entries that are older
            than maximal seen time minus ``cutoff``. This parameter is also used to clear
            memory. It allows to release memory used by entries that won't change.

        keep_results: If set to True, keeps all results of the operator. If set to False,
            keeps only results that are newer than maximal seen time minus ``cutoff``.
            Can't be set to ``False``, when ``cutoff`` is ``None``.

        the window stops accepting the data and sends the results to the output.
