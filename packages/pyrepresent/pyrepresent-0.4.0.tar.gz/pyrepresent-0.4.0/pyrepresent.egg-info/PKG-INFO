before we start
---------------

#### description:

> - This module creates an easy-to-use, versatile dynamic system for representing python objects as strings.
> - The string representation can be achieved for any python object, through functional or object-oriented usage.
> - It is possible to configure many specific ways to display data, hide attributes, represent nested objects,
	> circular references, memory address, attribute names and values, indentation, and mor.

#### dependencies:

- opening:
  As for this is a really complex program, which uses a lot of modules, there are required dependencies needed
  in order to run the program. keep in mined the program was writen in python 3.9, so any python version lower
  than 3.9 might not work properly. Moreover, built-in python modules are being used, so keep that in mind.

- install app dependencies by writing the "-r" option to install the requirements
  writen in a file, and write the following line in the project directory:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

run a test
-----------

#### run from windows command line (inside the project directory)
- run with python by writing to the command line in the project directory:
````
python test.py
````
