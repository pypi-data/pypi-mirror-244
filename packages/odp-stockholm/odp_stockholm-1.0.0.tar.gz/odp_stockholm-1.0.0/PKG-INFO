Asynchronous Python client for the open datasets of Stockholm (Sweden).

## About

A python package with which you can retrieve data from the Open Data Platform of Stockholm via [their API][api]. This package was initially created to only retrieve parking data from the API, but the code base is made in such a way that it is easy to extend for other datasets from the same platform.

## Installation

```bash
pip install odp-stockholm
```

## Datasets

You can read the following datasets with this package:

- [Disabled parkings / rörelsehindrade förare med särskilt tillstånd][parking_api]

To use the data you need an API key, which you can request via [this link][request_api_key].

    <summary>Click here to get more details</summary>

### Disabled parkings (2045 locations)

You can use the following parameters in your request:

- **limit** (default: 10) - How many results you want to retrieve.

| Variable | Type | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :---------- |
| `location_id` | string | The id of the location |
| `location_type` | string | The type of the location |
| `number` | integer | How many parking spots there are on this location |
| `street` | string | The street name of the location |
| `address` | string | The address of the location |
| `district` | string | The district name where the location is |
| `parking_rate` | string | The parking rate of the location |
| `parking_rules` | string | URL to the parking regulations of Stockholm |
| `valid_from` | datetime | The date from when the parking is valid |
| `valid_to` | datetime (or None) | The date until when the parking is valid |
| `coordinates` | list[float] | The coordinates of the location |
</details>

### Example

```python
import asyncio

from odp_stockholm import ParkingStockholm


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on using this package."""
    async with ParkingStockholm(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY") as client:
        locations = await client.disabled_parkings(
            limit=10,
        )
        print(locations)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

The simplest way to begin is by utilizing the [Dev Container][devcontainer]
feature of Visual Studio Code or by opening a CodeSpace directly on GitHub.
By clicking the button below you immediately start a Dev Container in Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

*Now you're all set to get started!*

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
