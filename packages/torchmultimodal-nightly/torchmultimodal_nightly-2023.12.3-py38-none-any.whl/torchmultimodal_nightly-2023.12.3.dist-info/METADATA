# TorchMultimodal (Beta Release)

## Introduction
TorchMultimodal is a PyTorch library for training state-of-the-art multimodal multi-task models at scale. It provides:
- A repository of modular and composable building blocks (models, fusion layers, loss functions, datasets and utilities).
- A repository of examples that show how to combine these building blocks with components and common infrastructure from across the PyTorch Ecosystem to replicate state-of-the-art models published in the literature. These examples should serve as baselines for ongoing research in the field, as well as a starting point for future work.

As a first open source example, researchers will be able to train and extend FLAVA using TorchMultimodal.

## Installation

TorchMultimodal requires Python >= 3.8. The library can be installed with or without CUDA support.
The following assumes conda is installed.

### Prerequisites
1. Install conda environment

    ```
    conda create -n torch-multimodal python=\
    conda activate torch-multimodal
    ```

2. Install pytorch, torchvision, and torchaudio. See [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

    ```
    # Use the current CUDA version as seen [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
    # Select the nightly Pytorch build, Linux as the OS, and conda. Pick the most recent CUDA version.
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=\ -c pytorch-nightly -c nvidia

    # For CPU-only install
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch-nightly
    ```

### Install from binaries

Nightly binary on Linux for Python 3.8 and 3.9 can be installed via pip wheels.
For now we only support Linux platform through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

```
python -m pip install torchmultimodal-nightly
```

### Building from Source

Alternatively, you can also build from our source code and run our [examples](https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal/tree/main/examples):

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal.git multimodal
cd multimodal

pip install -e .
```
For developers please follow the [development installation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-installation).

## Documentation

The library builds on the following concepts:
- **Architectures**: These are general and composable classes that capture the core logic associated with a family of models. In most cases these take modules as inputs instead of flat arguments (see Models below). Examples include the `LateFusion`, `FLAVA` and `CLIP`. Users should either reuse an existing architecture or a contribute a new one. We avoid inheritance as much as possible.

- **Models**: These are specific instantiations of a given architecture implemented using builder functions. The builder functions take as input all of the parameters for constructing the modules needed to instantiate the architecture. See [cnn_lstm.py](https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal/blob/main/examples/cnn_lstm/cnn_lstm.py) for an example.

- **Modules**: These are self-contained components that can be stitched up in various ways to build an architecture. See [lstm_encoder.py](https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal/blob/main/examples/cnn_lstm/lstm_encoder.py) as an example.
