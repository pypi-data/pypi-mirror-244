The following set of instructions is a step-by-step guide to reproduce the result in :ref:`[2] <ref2>`, which is an example of using |project|.

Dataset
=======

The paper uses the HF radar dataset from the Monterey Bay region in California, USA. The HF radar can be accessed publicly through the `national HF radar network gateway <http://cordc.ucsd.edu/projects/mapping/>`__ maintained by the Coastal Observing Research and Development Center. Please follow these steps to obtain the data file.

**Dataset Webpage:** The studied data is available through its `OpenDap page <https://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu/thredds/dodsC/HFR/USWC/2km/hourly/RTV/HFRADAR_US_West_Coast_2km_Resolution_Hourly_RTV_best.ncd.html>`__. In particular, the **OpenDap URL** of this dataset is

.. code-block:: bash

   http://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu/thredds/dodsC/HFR/USWC/2km/hourly/RTV/HFRADAR_US_West_Coast_2km_Resolution_Hourly_RTV_best.ncd

**Navigate to Dataset Webpage:** To navigate to the above webpage, visit `CORDC THREDDS Serever <https://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu/thredds/catalog.html>`__. From there, click on `HF RADAR, US West Coast <https://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu/thredds/HFRADAR_USWC.html>`__, and select `HFRADAR US West Coast 2km Resolution Hourly RTV <https://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu/thredds/catalog/HFR/USWC/2km/hourly/RTV/catalog.html>`__ and choose `Best Time Series <https://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu/thredds/catalog/HFR/USWC/2km/hourly/RTV/catalog.html?dataset=HFR/USWC/2km/hourly/RTV/HFRADAR_US_West_Coast_2km_Resolution_Hourly_RTV_best.ncd>`__.

**Subseting Data:** The above dataset contains the HF radar covering the west coast of the US from 2012 to the present date with 2km resolution and hourly updates. In the examples below, we focus on a spatial subset of this dataset within the Monterey Bay region for January 2017.

Reproducing Results
===================

The scripts to reproduce the results can be found in the source code of |project| under the directory |script_dir|_.

Reproducing Figure 1

   :class: custom-dark

   **Figure 1:** *Panels (a) and (b) display the east and north GDOP values, respectively, calculated along the northern California coast using the radar configurations indicated by the red dots and their corresponding code names. Panel (c) shows the total GDOP, which is a measure of the overall quality of the estimation of the velocity vector. Panel (d) represents the average HF radar data availability for January 2017, indicating the locations with missing data that generally correspond to high total GDOP values.*

Reproducing Figure 2 to Figure 9
--------------------------------

.. prompt:: bash

    python restoreio_mwe.py

The above python script executes the following lines of code, which is given in **Listing 1** of the manuscript. Users may change the settings in the function arguments below. For further details, refer to the API reference documentation of the function :func:`restoreio.restore` function.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Install restoreio with: pip install restoreio

    ...       'AR_US_West_Coast_2km_Resolution_Hou' + \
    ...       'rly_RTV_best.ncd'

    >>> # Generate ensemble and reconstruct gaps
    >>> restore(input=url, output='output.nc',

   **Figure 2:** *Panels (a) and (b) show the east and north components of the ocean's current velocity as measured by HF radars in Monterey Bay on January 25-th, 2017, at 3:00 UTC. The regions inside the solid black curves represent missing data that was filtered out due to high GDOP values from the original measurement. Panels (c) and (d) respectively show the east and north components of the velocity error computed for the locations where velocity data is available in Panels (a) and (b).*

Reproducing Figure 10
---------------------

* First, run ``plot_js_divergence.sh`` script:

  .. prompt:: bash
  
      bash plot_js_divergence.sh
  
  The above script creates a directory called ``output_js_divergence`` and stores the output files ``output-001.nc`` to ``output-200.nc``.

* Next, run ``plot_js_divergence.py`` script:
  
  .. prompt:: bash
  
      python plot_js_divergence.py
  
.. figure:: _static/images/plots/js_distance.png
 :align: left
 :figwidth: 100%
 :width: 70%
 :class: custom-dark
 
 **Figure 10:** *The JS distance between the probability distributions* :math:`p_m(\boldsymbol{x}, \xi)` *and* :math:`p_n(\boldsymbol{x}, \xi)` *is shown as a function of* :math:`m = 0, \dots , n`. *These two distributions correspond to the ensemble generated by the* :math:`m` *term (truncated) and* :math:`n` *term (complete) KL expansions, respectively. We note that the abscissa of the figure is displayed as the percentage of the ratio* :math:`m/n` *where* :math:`n = 485`.

Reproducing Figure 11
---------------------

Run ``plot_vel_distribution.py`` script:

.. prompt:: bash

    python plot_vel_distribution.py
  
The above script creates the following plot:

Circle points denote the empirical PDF, the solid black curve indicates the standard normal distribution* :math:`\mathcal{N}(0, 1)`, *and the dashed black curve shows the best-fit generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) with the density function* :math:`p(v) \propto \exp(-\vert v \vert^{\beta})`. *The abscissa in both figures represents the normalized velocity components, with* :math:`\sigma` *being the standard deviation of the respective data.*
