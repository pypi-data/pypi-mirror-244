    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The purpose of of this program is to compare Bills of Materials (BOMs)
      derived from a CAD program (like SolidWorks) and compare them to BOMs
      stored in an ERP database program (like that of SyteLine).  The CAD and
      ERP programs must be able to export to excel files because that is where
      this program gathers BOMs from for comparison.</p>

    <h2 id="basics">Basics you need to know</h2>
    <p>The file names for BOMs that come from the CAD program should be
      the part no. of the BOM followed by _sw.xlsx. That is, names like
      0300-2010-005_sw.xlsx, 093352_sw.xlsx, and 35K2445_sw.xlsx are all
      legitimate file names. The names of the files from the ERP database will end
      with _sl.xlsx. Thus the names will look like 0300-2010-005_sl.xlsx,
      093352_sl.xlsx, and 35K2445_sl.xlsx. The program will match the
      0300-2010-005_sw.xlsx file to the 0300-2010-005_sl.xlsx file, and so forth.</p>

    <p>A file can contain a mulilevel BOM. For a BOM from the ERP program
      to be recognized as a multilevel BOM, a column named "Level" must exist
      (can be altered with <a href="#bomcheckcfg">bomcheck.cfg</a>)
      that gives the relative level of a subassembly
      to the main assembly. The Level column starts out with "0" for the top
      level assembly, "1" for parts/subassemblies under the main assembly, "2" for
      a parts/subassembly under a Level "1" subassembly, and so forth. From the
      CAD program, it is similar, but instead item nos. indicate the Level, e.g. item
      nos. like 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3, 4, etc., where item 3
      is a subassembly with parts under it. </p>

    <p><b>Tip #1:</b> If two underscore characters exist within a file name,
      like 094433_testBOM_sw.xlsx, the characters between the two underscore
      characters will be ignored.  In this case testBOM.</p>

    <p><b>Tip #2:</b> If the SyteLine BOM is a multilevel BOM (i.e. has a column
      named "Level"), then any characters proceeding the "_sl.xlsx" characters
      will be ignored. Instead the part number is obtained from within the
      Excel file where the part no. for Level 0 is shown.</p>


    <h2 id="run">How to run bomcheck</h2>
    <p>To run the program from the command line, run like this (assuming you
      did the <i>pip install bomcheck</i> method do install bomcheck.py to
      your system):</p>

      <ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><code>C:\> bomcheck</code></li></ul>

    <p>(Use bomcheckgui to run from a Graphical User Interface.)  When the
      above command is run, help info will be shown about required
      command line arguments.</p>

    <p> If you obtain the file named bomcheck.py, which is the source code for
      bomcheck, you can run bomcheck from within a <a href="https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-interective-shell">python shell</a>.
      Within bomcheck.py there is a function named bomcheck().  Excecute this
      function to run bomcheck from within the shell.  Execute it like this:</p>


      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
          <li><code>>>> import bomcheck as bc</code></li>
          <li><code>>>> bc.bomcheck(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)</code></li>
      </ul>

    <p>(Note: requirements for running from a shell are pandas>=1.2,
       toml>=0.10, openpyxl>=3.0, and python>=3.11) To see information
       about arguments used in bomcheck():
    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li><code>>>> help(bc.bomcheck)</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that if an error occurs when checking your BOMs, or if bomcheck is
      confused about some data that was entered, a message will be shown that
      describes the problem. Otherwise look for something you may have done
      wrong like failing to attach the _sl.xlsx or _sw.xlsx characters to the
      file name.
    </p>

    <p>The columns I, Q, D, and U show Xs if Item, Quantity, Description, or
      Unit of measure don't match between the SolidWorks BOM and the ERP BOM.
      Q_sw and Q_sl are quanties in SolidWorks and the ERP. Desription_sw and
      Description_sl are a comparison of descriptions. U_sw and U_sl are a
      comparison of units of measure. The 1309031 part is in the ERP but
      not in SolidWorks, thus the blank space in columns for the SolidWorks
      category.  Likewise, 130039 is in SolidWorks, but not in the ERP BOM</p>


    <h2 id="UofM">Units of Measure</h2>
    <p>If a unit of measure (U/M) is not given for a value in the Length column
      of a SolidWorks' BOM, then the U/M is assumed to be Inches (unless changed
      in the bomcheck.cfg file). However the U/M can be explicity specified,
      e.g. <b>336.7mm</b>. The program will recognize the following abreviations
      for U/Ms:</p>

    <p>in, inch, ”, ft, ', feet, foot, yrd, yd, yard, mm, millimeter, cm,
      centimeter, m, meter, mtr, sqin, sqi, sqft, sqf, sqyd, sqy, sqmm, sqcm,
      sqm, pint, pt, qt, quart, gal, g, gallon, ltr, l, liter.</p>

    <p>When the program is run, values will be converted to the U/M given in the
      ERP database program. For example, 336.7mm will be converted to 1.10 ft,
      and 8 pints will be converted to 1.00 gal. Other names that can be
      substituted for the column name LENGTH in a SolidWorks BOM are: SIZE,
      Length, L, SIZE, AMT, AMOUNT, and MEAS.  Names are case sensitive.</p>


    <h2 id="ImportToExcel">Import a CSV file into Excel</h2>
    <p>Bomcheck can export results to a CSV file which can be imported into
     Microsoft Excel. To do this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Excel</li>
        <li>Click New, then click on Blank workbook</li>
        <li>Click on the Data tab</li>
        <li>Click Get Data From Text/CSV</li>
        <li>Navigate to the CSV-formatted file saved on your system, select it, then click Import </li>
        <li>This will open the menu asking for settings to use for import</li>
        <li>For File Origin choose 65001: Unicode (UTF-8)</li>
        <li>For Delimiter choose Tab</li>
        <li>For Data Type Detection, use the default.  Normally is <i>Based on first 200 rows</i></li>
        <li>Click the Load button</li>
      </ul>


    <h2 id="ERPvsERP">ERP BOM vs ERP BOM howto</h2>
    <p>The bomcheck program has been designed specifically to compare a CAD BOM
       (like from SolidWorks) to an ERP BOM (like from SyteLine).  However with
       a bit of finagaling, it can be used to compare an ERP BOM to an ERP BOM.
       Here's how:</p>

       <ol>
           <li>Extract the two BOM's you wish to compare and save them to
               Excel files.  Use <u>multilevel</u> BOMs.  For example, let's imagine
               you saved them to 101304_sl.xlsx and 089432_sl.xlsx</li>
           <li>Rename the first file to 101304_sw.xlsx</li>
           <li>Open in Excel the 101304_sw.xlsx file and go to the line that
               shows level 0:
                <table class="table table-striped table-sm">
                  <thead>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="col">Level</th>
                      <th scope="col">Item</th>
                      <th scope="col">Description</th>
                      <th scope="col">Qty Per</th>
                      <th scope="col">U/M</th </tr>
                  </thead>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td>0</td>
                      <td>101304</td>
                      <td>DZS 300V TRIPLEX</td>
                      <td>1.000</td>
                      <td>EA</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                Change the Item there from 101304 to 089432.
           </li>
         <li>Save the Excel file and run the bomcheck program and compare
             the 101304_sw.xlsx and the 089432_sl.xlsx.  This works because for
             multilevel ERP BOMs the 101304 in the filename is ignored and
             bomcheck instead gets the Item shown at level 0.
         </li>
         <li>When you look at your BOM check results, you won't see number
             101304 listed anywhere.  Instead look for the number 089432.
             You'll see the comparison results there. (Subassembly BOMs will
             be present also.)  The parts, quantities, etc. for the 101304
             system will be shown in the "sw" columns where numbers from a CAD
             file are normally shown.
         </li>
      </ol>

     <p>If you have BOMs that are NOT multilevel, then rename the 101304_sw.xlsx
       file to 089432_sw.xlsx, and then compare it to the 089422_sl.xlsx file.</p>


     <h2 id="PN_MISSING">description_missing & PN_MISSING</h2>
     <p>If in the <i>Description</i> field of a BOM that came from a CAD program you
        see description_missing, it means that the description in the
        CAD BOM  was left blank.</p>

     <p>If in the <i>Item</i> field of a BOM that came from a CAD program you
        see PN_MISSING, it means that the part number in the CAD BOM
        was left blank.</p>

     <p>If you don't want to see any rows showing the PN_MISSING message,
       enter PN_MISSING in the drop list and make the drop list active.

     <h2 id="droplist">drop list & exceptions list</h2>
     <p>Perhaps you have parts that show in the BOM of your CAD program that
        are not not shown on the BOM in your ERP program; and you don't want
        them to show.  For example hardware bolts and nuts that are common
        stock items.  These will show up as errors when bomcheck is run.
        However you can exclude these items from the check.  To to this enter
        these items in what is called a drop list.  The list will look something
        like this:</p>

     <p>['3*-025', '3182-*']</p>

     <p>Add as many items to the list as you like.  If there are exceptions
       to this that you would like to account for, then create an exceptions
       list.  It will look something like this:</p>

     <p>['3042-*-025', '3182-0000-001']</p>


    <h2 id="bomcheckcfg">bomcheck.cfg</h2>
    <p>Download the file named bomcheck.cfg
      <a href="https://github.com/kcarlton55/bomcheck/blob/master/docs/" download>(download link)</a>
      that contains settings that you can change in order to alter how the
      bomcheck program behaves.  For example, you can change units of measure,
      change what column headings bomcheck recognizes, redirect links
      in bomcheckgui's help menu, etc.  (A company can redirect
      to help files that read according to their preference.)</p>

      <p>Open bomcheck.cfg with a text editor program
      such as Microsoft's Wordpad.  There you will see settings that can be
      changed.</p>

    <p>Place bomcheck.cfg in a directory of your choosing.  Then set the location
      of this file via an argument setting in the bomcheck function, or, if you
      are using bomcheckgui, go to the settings section and enter the location
      there.
