#### description:

- visit the docs to learn more about this project and how to develop with it.

- opening:
  As for this is a really complex program, which uses a lot of modules, there are required dependencies needed
  in order to run the program. keep in mined the program was writen in python 3.9, so any python version lower
  than 3.8 might not work properly. Moreover, built-in python modules are being used, so keep that in mind.

- install app dependencies by writing the "-r" option to install the requirements
  writen in a file, and write the following line in the project directory:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

run a test

#### run from windows command line (inside the project directory)
- run with python by writing to the command line in the project directory:
````
