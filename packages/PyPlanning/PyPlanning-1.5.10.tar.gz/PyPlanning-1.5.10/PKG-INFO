ℹ️ Created in 2022 by [Pierre Raybaut](https://github.com/PierreRaybaut), developed and maintained by the [PyPlanning](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/PyPlanning) project team with the support of [Codra](https://codra.net/).

PyPlanning is a small planning tool initially developed for internal use at [Codra](https://codra.net/). The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use planning tool for small teams or small projects, i.e. in cases where using a full-featured project management software is overkill.

# Examples

## Team schedule (daily view)

# Future plans

## High-priority tasks

Fix the following issues:

[ ] FIXME: Sometimes, task color combox box is not shown in the tree widget (a line edit is shown instead)
[ ] TODO: Performance: process only gantt objects affected by changes
[ ] TODO: Performance: update only visible chart? (this is it!)
[ ] TODO: Performance: run chart update in a thread?
[ ] TODO: New feature: custom chart names (instead of automatic indexed names)

## Medium-priority tasks

Implement the following features:

[ ] TODO: Add support for hidden time frames in charts, for improving readability in case of long tasks
[ ] TODO: Task: add "duplicate" action
[ ] TODO: Task tree widget: add sub-context-menu "Bind to": resources
[ ] TODO: Chart tree widget: add multiple checkboxes to select projects
[ ] TODO: Chart tree widget: add QComboBox for editing the "project" field

## Low-priority tasks

Implement the following features:

[ ] TODO: Vacation: add the possibility to set duration in days
[ ] TODO: Add "percent_done" support for tasks
[ ] TODO: Performance: add an option to update on demand?
[ ] TODO: Replace python-gantt (planning/gantt.py) by an alternative with less
    restrictive license terms (no GPL!)

# License

PyPlanning is licensed under the terms of the GPL v3 license. This is prescribed by
the library upon which PyPlanning depends on for generating SVG Gantt plannings
(see GPL-based library code ([python-gantt](https://pypi.org/project/python-gantt/)).
The code of this library has been drastically patched and adapted to PyPlanning needs.
