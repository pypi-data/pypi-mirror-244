# Immanuel

Immanuel is a Python >= 3.10 package to allow your applications to painlessly produce simple, readable, chart-centred astrology data from [pyswisseph](https://github.com/astrorigin/pyswisseph), with extra calculations modelled on those of [astro.com](https://astro.com) and [Astro Gold](https://www.astrogold.io). Easy-to-use chart classes take date, time, and location data and return an object which can be output as either human-friendly text or easily serialised into JSON.

## Documentation

Full markdown documentation is available [here](https://github.com/theriftlab/immanuel-python/tree/v1.0.11/docs/0-contents.md).

## Quick Start

If all that documentation looks boring, you can get started generating chart data in minutes. Simply install Immanuel, import the chart classes into your project, and with one line of code you can produce all the data you need to construct a full chart.

## Installation

```bash
pip install immanuel
```

## Chart Types

Currently Immanuel supports the following chart types:

* Natal
* Solar return
* Progressed
* Synastry
* Composite

## Example

Chart class constructors take dates in standard timezone-naive ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS), and coordinates in either standard text format (as in the following examples) or decimal. To generate data for a natal chart, you could use something like this:

```python
from immanuel import charts


natal = charts.Natal(dob='2000-01-01 10:00', lat='32n43', lon='117w09')
```

## Returned Chart Data

The various chart types return their own sets of data, but for a basic natal chart you can expect to receive the following:

* Chart date
* Chart coordinates
* House system
* Chart shape type (eg. bowl, splash etc.)
* Whether the chart is diurnal (ie. daytime)
* Moon phase
* All chart objects (eg. planets, asteroids, primary angles etc.) and their positions & dignities if applicable
* Houses
* Aspects
* Weightings (ie. which objects are in which elements / modalities etc.)

The data is available in both human-readable and JSON format. To see the human-readable planets & angles in the above natal chart:

```python
for object in natal.objects.values():
    print(object)
```

This will output all the chart objects in this format:

```
Sun 10°37'26" in Capricorn, 11th House
Moon 16°19'29" in Scorpio, 8th House
...
```

We can get much more data from the JSON output like this:

```python
# Add these extra imports at the top...
import json
from immanuel.classes.serialize import ToJSON

# ...and try this after you've generated your chart

print(json.dumps(natal.objects, cls=ToJSON, indent=4))
```

Which will output all the chart objects in this format:

```json

        ]
    },
    "score": 3
}
```

Note that the entire chart can also be serialized to JSON, eg.:

```python
print(json.dumps(natal, cls=ToJSON, indent=4))
```

## Calculations

Calculations for the secondary progressions are based on those of astro.com. The same three methods for MC progression are available and will produce the same progressed date, sidereal time, and house positions as astro.com.

Planetary dignity scores are based on those of Astro Gold, although these are somewhat flexible via the settings.

## Settings

The full documentation covers [settings](docs/6-settings.md) in more detail, but much of the output can be customised. The settings module allows you specify what data each chart returns, what planets etc. to include, and to fine-tune many intricate details of the aspect calculations.

## Tests

Tests are available via pytest. If you have cloned the repo, simply run pytest from the root:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
