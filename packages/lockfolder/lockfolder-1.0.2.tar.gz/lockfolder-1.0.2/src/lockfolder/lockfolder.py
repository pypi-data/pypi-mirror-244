This is a mutex system.

Proposition:

1. The system never(*) grants a lock to more than one process.
2. Live-locks are acceptable.
3. Security and file permissions are NOT concerns.
4. To work on a system, it requires:
   A. a conventional filesystem
   B. process PIDs, verifiable by other processes
   C. process create times, verifiable by other processes

"never" (*): Failure in the event of v4 GUID collision is acceptable.


Basic strategy:

* each process self-assigns a GUID
* each process notes its PID
* each process notes its create-time
* a folder keeps the locks for the resource ("bids" and "locks" are
  the same thing in this system)
* the procedure is "check-bid-check", and if any check shows another
  bid/lock, the process deletes its own bid (if it got that far) and
  returns "fail"
* if the "check-bid-check" passes, then the bid is left until the
  process completes, at which point the bid is deleted
* bids contain the process PID and creation time of the process, and
  may be deleted by any process that wishes to challenge a prior bid,
  provided that it can determine that a process created at
  <create-time> with process ID <PID> is no longer running
* upon a fail, at the programmer's discretion, processes may delay and
  retry, with delays having a random component, and increasing
  duration between attempts

I have discussed the strategy on Reddit:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/186ot93/is_this_checkbidcheck_mutex_strategy_okay/


Notes about this implementation:

* written for multiple competing processes
* is NOT thread-safe, and not written for multiple competing threads
* assumes that PIDs are not recycled within one second
  -- that is, the precision on recorded process create times is 1 second
  -- the failure story is this:
     If a process places a lock, dies or is killed before it removes
     its lock, and then another process with the same PID is created
     in the same second, (HIGHLY UNLIKELY,) then the "stale lock" will
     not be detected, until this process dies, and is replaced by
     either no process having that PID, or a process with that PID
     created that didn't start in the same second.


The simplest way to use this is as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  import pathlib
  from lockfolder import lockfolder

  lockfolder.init()

  p = pathlib.Path("path/to/lockfolder")

  if lockfolder.lock(p):
      print("aquired lock")
      ...
      ...
      lockfolder.unlock(p)
   else:
      print("failed to aquire lock")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adapt to context manager, throw-finally systems, decorator, what have
you, as you like.


Lock files are JSON files that are logically equivalent to:

----------[ filename: <GUID>.json ]-----------------------------------
  {
    "PID": <integer PID>,
    "CREATED": <integer timestamp>
  }
----------------------------------------------------------------------
