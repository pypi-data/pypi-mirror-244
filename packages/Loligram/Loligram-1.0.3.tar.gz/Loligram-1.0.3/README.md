## Loligram

> Elegant, modern and asynchronous Telegram MTProto API framework in Python for users and bots

``` python
from loligram import Client, filters

app = Client("my_account")


@app.on_message(filters.private)
async def hello(client, message):
    await message.reply("Hello from Loligram!")


app.run()
```

**Loligram** is a modern, elegant and asynchronous [MTProto API](https://docs.loligram.org/topics/mtproto-vs-botapi)
framework. It enables you to easily interact with the main Telegram API through a user account (custom client) or a bot
identity (bot API alternative) using Python.
