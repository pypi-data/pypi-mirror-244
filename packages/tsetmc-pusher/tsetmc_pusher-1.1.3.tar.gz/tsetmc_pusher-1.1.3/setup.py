This project uses the websocket technology to build a pusher around the realtime data \
for Tehran Stock Exchange. Source data is crawled from the TSETMC website on optimized \
intervals. Users can connect to the websocket server and subscribe to as many instruments \
as they like. Afterwards, each time data for the subscribed instruments is updated, the \
changes will be pushed to the clients.
