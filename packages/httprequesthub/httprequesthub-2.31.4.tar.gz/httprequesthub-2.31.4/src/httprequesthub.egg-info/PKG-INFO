HttpRequestHub: An Exemplar HTTP Interaction Library
====================================================

**HttpRequestHub** stands as a testament to the synergy of simplicity and elegance within the realm of HTTP libraries. This adept Python library facilitates the intricacies of handling HTTP/1.1 requests with unparalleled ease, obviating the need for manual manipulation of query strings or the meticulous form-encoding of `PUT` and `POST` data — thanks to the intuitive `json` method that has become the contemporary standard.

Effortless Interaction with HTTP/1.1
------------------------------------

Consider the concise yet expressive code snippet below, showcasing the power and simplicity of **HttpRequestHub**:

```
  import httprequesthub
  r = httprequesthub.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
  print(r.status_code)
  # Output: 200
  print(r.headers['content-type'])
  # Output: 'application/json; charset=utf8'
  print(r.encoding)
  # Output: 'utf-8'
  print(r.text)
  # Output: '{"authenticated": true, ...'
  print(r.json())
  # Output: {'authenticated': True, ...}
```

Installation and Compatibility
------------------------------

To embark on the journey of seamless HTTP communication, one can effortlessly install **HttpRequestHub** from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the following command:
```
  $ python -m pip install httprequesthub
