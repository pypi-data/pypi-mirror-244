# Future

* Make `group` use the Spyral `View` mechanims. Provide a "frozen group" and a "dynamic group".
* Support for `turtle` style graphics, using animations
* More basic shapes like `triangle`, `star`, ...?
* Handle *potential* collision checks "if the object were placed here", circular, etc.
* Update documentation to explain the `destroy` function
* Improve the error handling in as many situations as possible
