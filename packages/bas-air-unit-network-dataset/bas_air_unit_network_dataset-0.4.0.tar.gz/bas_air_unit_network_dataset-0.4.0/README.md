# BAS Air Unit Network Dataset

Management of the network of routes and waypoints used by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Air Unit.

Including a utility to process routes and waypoints for use in handheld and aircraft GPS devices used by the Air Unit.

## Overview

### Purpose

To support the BAS Air Unit manage their network of routes and waypoints such that:

* information is internally consistent, through defined structures and constraints
* information is interoperable between different systems, through the use of open/standard formats
* information is well described and sharable with other teams, through distribution as datasets (through the 
  [Ops Data Store ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store) for example)

**Note:** This project is focused on needs within the British Antarctic Survey. It has been open-sourced in case it's
of use to others with similar or related needs. Some resources, indicated with a ðŸ›¡ symbol, are not accessible publicly.

### Background

This project was developed in response to discussions and requests with the BAS Air Unit to review and simplify the 
process they used to manage their network of waypoints, and to ensure its future sustainability.

BAS staff can read more about this background in this 
[GitLab issue ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-support/-/issues/134).

### Status

This project is a mature alpha. This means:

* all, or parts, of this project:
  * may, but should not, stop working (due to regressions or instability)
  * may not work correctly, or as expectedly (including destructively)
  * may change at any time (in terms of implementation or functionality)
* documentation may be missing or incorrect
* support for this project is provided on a best efforts / 'as is' basis
* outputs from this project should not be relied upon for operation use without thorough scrutiny

### Limitations

This service has a number of limitations, including:

* the Air Unit Network utility does not support multiple, or additional, networks
* the Air Unit Network utility does not require route names to follow the required naming convention
* the Air Unit Network utility does not require waypoint identifiers to be unique across all waypoints
* the Air Unit Network utility does not require waypoint comments to follow the required GPX comment structure
* the Air Unit Network utility does not require waypoints within imported routes to be listed as standalone waypoints
* comments for waypoints use an overly complex structure to support an ad-hoc serialisation format within GPX files
* Unicode characters (such as emoji) are unsupported in route/waypoint names, comments, etc.
* CSV outputs are not designed for printing (i.e. column formatting and page breaks)

Some or all of these limitations may be addressed in future improvements to this project. See the project 
[issue tracker ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store/-/issues) for details.

## Usage

### Loading features from GPX files

If using a GPX file to load waypoints and routes into a network, for waypoints these requirements must be met in 
addition to the constraints from the [Information Model](#information-model):

- the GPX comment field should consist of 5 elements, in the order below, separated with a vertical bar (`|`):
  - *name*: a full, or formal name for the waypoint (maximum 17 characters)
  - *co-located with*: name of a related depot, instrument and/or other feature - use `N/A` if not relevant
  - *last accessed at*: date waypoint was last accessed in the form `YYYY-MM-DD` - use `N/A` if unvisited
  - *last accessed by*: pilot that that last accessed waypoint - use `N/A` if unvisited
  - *comment*: any other information - use `N/A` if not relevant

For example (a co-located, previously visited, waypoint with a full name and additional information):

* identifier: `ALPHA`
* comment: `Alpha 001 | Dog | 2014-12-24 | CW | Bring treats.`

For example (a standalone, unvisited, waypoint with no full/formal name or additional information):

* identifier: `BRAVO`
* comment: `N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A`

**Note:** Only the 'name' in a comment will be included in FPL waypoints.

### Creating outputs

See the [`tests/create_outputs.py`](tests/create_outputs.py) for an example of converting a set of input waypoints and 
routes into output formats, creating an [Output Directory](#output-directory), using an instance of the 
`MainAirUnitNetwork` class.

The `Network` class (on which the `MainAirUnitNetwork` class is based) includes a built-in method for loading features 
from a GPX file (used in the example above). To load data from other data sources, construct `Waypoint` and `Route` 
features directly and add to the Network class.

### Output directory

When using the `MainAirUnitNetwork` class from this project to process waypoints and routes, an output directory 
similar to the example below will be created. This directory should be held in a suitable location where all relevant
users can access it.

A typical/example output directory:

```
/path/to/output/directory
â”œâ”€â”€ CSV
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 00_WAYPOINTS_DDM_2023_12_03.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 00_WAYPOINTS_DD_2023_12_03.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ FPL
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 00_NETWORK_2023_12_03.fpl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_BRAVO_TO_ALPHA.fpl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02_BRAVO_TO_BRAVO.fpl
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 03_BRAVO_TO_LIMA.fpl
â””â”€â”€ GPX
    â””â”€â”€ 00_NETWORK_2023_12_03.gpx
```

#### Access control

The Air Unit Network utility does not include access control. If needed, access controls should be applied to the
output directory, as is the case for the [Ops Data Store ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/ops-data-store) for 
example.

## Implementation

This project consists of:

* a description and schema for the main BAS Air Unit travel network (routes and waypoints)
* a Python library to:
  * import waypoints and routes from a GPX file, or other data source
  * export waypoints and routes into a range of output formats (currently CSV, GPX and Garmin FPL)

### Information model

The BAS Air Unit Network information model consists of two entities, forming two, related, datasets:

1. **Waypoints**: Features representing landing sites used by the Air Unit, usually co-located with a BAS Operations 
   depot, field camp or a science/monitoring instrument 
2. **Routes**: Features representing formally defined, frequently travelled, paths between two or more Waypoints, as 
   opposed to ad-hoc paths

For example:

* **Waypoints**: Fossil Bluff
* **Routes**: Rothera to Fossil Bluff

There is a many-to-many relationship between Waypoints and Routes. I.e. a Waypoint can be part of many Routes, and 
Routes can contain many Waypoints.

**Note:** This information model is abstract and requires implementing. See the [Data model](#data-model) section for 
the current implementation.

##### ID (Waypoint)

IDs:

* MUST be unique
* MUST NOT be based on any information contained within the Waypoint
* MAY use any format/scheme:
  * the same scheme SHOULD be used for all IDs
  * non-sequential schemes are recommended

**Note:** This ID can be used to refer to each Waypoint in other systems (i.e. as a foreign identifier).

##### Identifiers (Waypoint)

Identifiers:

* MUST be between 1 and 6 uppercase alphanumeric characters without spaces (A-Z, 0-9)
* MUST be unique across all Waypoints

##### Geometry (Waypoint)

Geometries:

* MUST be expressed in decimal degrees using the EPSG:4326 projection
* MUST consist of a longitude (X) and latitude (Y) dimension (2D point)

##### Name (Waypoint)

If specified:

* MUST be between 1 and 17 uppercase alphanumeric or space characters (A-Z, 0-9, ' ')

##### Co-located with (Waypoint)

No special comments.

##### Last accessed at (Waypoint)

If specified:

* MUST be expressed as an [ISO 8601-1:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/70907.html) date instant

##### Last accessed by (Waypoint)

If specified:

* MUST unambiguously reference an individual
* MAY use any scheme:
  * the same scheme SHOULD be used for all Waypoints

##### Comment (Waypoint)

No special comments.

#### Routes (information model)

| Property          | Name      | Type                      | Occurrence | Length | Description           | Example                      |

| `name`            | Name      | String                    | 1          | 1 - .. | Name or reference     | '01_ALPHA_TO_BRAVO'          |
| `waypoints`       | Waypoints | List of Waypoint entities | 2-n        | -      | Sequence of Waypoints | -                            |

##### ID (Route)

IDs:

* MUST be unique
* MUST NOT be based on any information contained within the Route
* MAY use any format/scheme:
  * the same scheme SHOULD be used for all IDs
  * non-sequential schemes are recommended

**Note:** This ID can be used to refer to each Route in other systems (i.e. as a foreign identifier).

##### Name (Route)

Names:

* MUST use the format `{Sequence}_{First Waypoint Identifier}_TO_{Last Waypoint Identifier}`, where `{Sequence}` is 
  a zero padded, two character, auto-incrementing prefix (e.g. '01', '02', ..., '99').

##### Waypoints (Route)

Waypoints in Routes:

* MUST be a subset of the set of Waypoints
  * i.e. waypoints in routes MUST be drawn from a common set, rather than defined ad-hoc or inline within a Route
* MUST be expressed as a sequence:
  * i.e. a list in a specific order from a start to finish via any number of other places
* MAY be included multiple times
  * i.e. the start and end can be the same Waypoint, or a route may pass through the same waypoint multiple times

### Data model

For use within the Python library included in this project, and as a reference to implementors for storing entities, a 
data model implementing the [Information model](#information-model) is available. For the later use-case, this data model assumes the
use of a relational model, specifically for SQLite (as an OGC GeoPackage) and PostgreSQL. 

This data model uses three entities:

1. **Waypoint**: Point features with attributes
2. **Route**: Features to contextualise a set of Waypoints, with attributes (such as route name)
3. **RouteWaypoint**: join between a Waypoint and a Route, with contextual attributes (such as sequence within route)

**Note:** This data model does not describe how entities are encoded in specific [Output Formats](#output-formats).

#### FIDs

Feature Identifiers (FIDs) are created automatically for features without one. FIDs are unique auto-incrementing 
integers, suitable for use as primary keys within relational database.

FIDs SHOULD be considered an implementation detail, and SHOULD be ignored in favour of ID properties (i.e. 'ID' rather 
than 'FID') outside the specific technology being used.

Consequently, FIDs SHOULD NOT be exposed to end users and their values or structure MUST NOT be relied upon.

#### ULIDs

[Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier (ULID)](https://github.com/ulid/spec)s are the scheme used 
for identifiers (IDs).

These IDs MAY be exposed to end users.

#### Waypoints (data model)

### Test network

A network consisting of 12 waypoints and 3 routes is used to:

1. test various edge cases
2. provide consistency for repeatable testing
3. prevent needing to use real data that might be sensitive

**WARNING!** This test network is entirely fictitious. It MUST NOT be used for any real navigation.

The canonical test network is stored in `tests/resources/test-network/test-network.json` and is versioned using a date
in the `meta.version` property. A QGIS project is also provided to visualise the test network and ensure derived 
outputs match expected test data.

This dataset does not follow any particular standard or output format as it's intended to be a superset of other 
formats and support properties that may not be part of any standard. Derived versions of the network in some standard 
formats are also available (from the same directory) for testing data loading, etc.

#### Updating test network

If updating the test network, ensure to:

1. update the version attribute in the test network to the current date
1. recreate derived versions of the network as needed (for example the GPX derived output) [1]
1. use the network utility to generate sample exports [2]
1. manually verify the QGIS project for visualising the network is correct and update/fix as needed

[1]

```
$ poetry run python tests/create_derived_test_outputs.py
```

[2]

```
$ poetry run python tests/create_outputs.py
```

After running, ensure all dates in files are updated to values set in `tests/compare_outputs.py`.

Where 'All Waypoints (Only)' outputs are produced, waypoints will be sorted alphabetically.

[1] These outputs can be produced but are intentionally excluded as they aren't used by the Air Unit. See this 
[GitLab issue ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/air-unit-network-dataset/-/issues/101) for details.

#### Output file names

Output files use an internal naming convention for all formats:

| Waypoints and Routes (Combined) | `00_NETWORK_{current date}.ext`     | `00_NETWORK_2014_12_24.ext`   |

Where `.ext` is a relevant file extension for each format (i.e. `.csv` for CSV outputs).

#### Output format - CSV

Notes:

* for compatibility with Microsoft Excel, CSV outputs include the UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM), which may cause issues
  with other tools/applications
* CSV outputs use the first row as a column names header
* outputs produced for all routes use a `route_name` column to distinguish rows related to each route
* `waypoint.geometries` can optionally be included as separate latitude (Y) and longitude (X) columns in either:
  * decimal degrees (`latitude_dd`, `longitude_dd` columns) - native format
  * degrees, decimal minutes (`latitude_ddm`, `longitude_ddm` columns) - format used in aviation

Limitations:

* all properties are encoded as strings, without type hints using extended CSV schemes etc.
* CSV outputs are not validated

#### Output format - GPX

Notes:

* GPX outputs are validated against the GPX XSD schema automatically

Limitations:

* GPX metadata fields (author, last updated, etc.) are not currently populated
* the GPX comment field is set to the `waypoint.name` property only, as GPS devices used by the Air Unit only support 
  comments of upto 16 characters

#### Output format - FPL

Notes:

* FPL outputs are validated against a custom version of the Garmin [FPL XSD schema](#fpl-xml-schema) automatically
* route names will use spaces instead of underscores in FPL files, as underscores aren't allowed in FPL route names

Limitations:

* the `waypoint.colocated_with`, `waypoint.last_accessed_at`, `waypoint.last_accessed_by` and `waypoint.comment` 
  properties are not included in FPL waypoint comments, as they are limited to 17 characters [1]
* underscores (`_`) characters are stripped from route names *within* FPL files (rather than the names *of* FPL 
  files), a local override is used to replace underscores with spaces (` `) to work around this limitation
* FPL metadata fields (author, last updated, etc.) are not currently populated

[1] This limit comes from the specific UI shown in the aircraft GPS used by the BAS Air Unit.

##### FPL XML schema

A copy of the Garmin FPL XML/XSD schema, http://www8.garmin.com/xmlschemas/FlightPlanv1.xsd, is included in this 
project to locally validate generated FPL outputs. This schema cannot be used for validation in its published form, as
it contains a number of invalid regular expressions. These regular expressions have been modified in the schema used 
in this project, which hopefully match Garmin's intentions.

In order to produce FPL files that match those produced by earlier processing scripts used by the BAS Air Unit, a 
number of other changes have been made to the local version of the FPL schema. These include:

* removing the requirement for a `<waypoints-table>` element to be included in all FPL files (relevant to route FPLs)
* removing the requirement for all `<waypoint>` elements within `<route>` elements to be included in a 
  `<waypoint-table>` element (as a consequence of the above)
* altering the regular expression used for the `<country-name>` element to allow the `_` characters

**Note:** It is hoped these local modifications will be removed in future through testing with the in-aircraft GPS.
See [#12 ðŸ›¡](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/air-unit-network-dataset/-/issues/32) for more information.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- libxml2 with `xmlint` binary available on Path
- read/write access to a suitable location for creating a [Workspace Directory](#workspace-directory)

**Note:** As of version 0.3.0, Windows is no longer a supported operating system for running this utility.

### Install Python package

It is strongly recommended to install the [Python Package](#development) in a Python virtual environment:

```
$ python -m venv /path/to/venv
$ source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python -m pip install bas-air-unit-network-dataset
```

## Development

### Local development environment

Check out project:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/air-unit-network-dataset.git
$ cd air-unit-network-dataset
```

**Note:** If you do not have access to the BAS GitLab instance, clone from GitHub as a read-only copy instead.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is used for managing the Python environment and dependencies.

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is strongly recommended to ensure the Python version is the same as the one
used in externally provisioned environments. This is currently *3.9.18*.

```
$ pyenv install 3.9.18
$ pyenv local 3.9.18
$ poetry install
```

### Editorconfig

For consistency is strongly recommended to configure your IDE or other editor to use the [EditorConfig](https://EditorConfig.org) settings defined in [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig).

### Dependencies

#### Dependency vulnerability checks

The [Safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) package is used to check dependencies against known vulnerabilities.

**WARNING!** As with all security tools, Safety is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.
In particular this is using the free vulnerability database, which is updated less frequently than paid options.

Checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration). To check locally:

```
$ poetry run safety check --full-report
```

#### Static security scanning

Ruff is configured to run [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit), a static analysis tool for Python.

**WARNING!** As with all security tools, Bandit is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.
In particular this tool can't check for issues that are only be detectable when running code.

#### `lxml` package (bandit)

Bandit identifies the use of `lxml` classes and methods as a security issue, specifically:

> Element to parse untrusted XML data is known to be vulnerable to XML attacks

The recommendation is to use a *safe* implementation of an XML processor (`defusedxml`) that can avoid entity bombs and 
other XML processing attacks. However, `defusedxml` does not offer all the methods we need and there does not appear
to be such another processor that does provide them.

The main vulnerability this security issue relates to is processing user input that can't be trusted. This isn't really
applicable to this library directly, but rather to where it's used in implementing projects. I.e. if this library is 
used in a service that accepts user input, an assessment must be made whether the input needs to be sanitised.

Within this library itself, the only input that is processed is test records, all of which are assumed to be safe to 
process.

### Code linting

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is used to lint and format Python files. Specific checks and config options are
set in `pyproject.toml`. Linting checks are run automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration).

To check locally:

```
$ poetry run ruff check src/ tests/
$ poetry run ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

To format files:

```
$ poetry run ruff format src/ tests/
```

## Testing

Basic end-to-end tests are performed automatically in [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration) to check the
[Test Network](#test-network) can be processed via the Network Utility using the 
[`tests/create_outputs.py`](tests/create_outputs.py).

```
$ poetry run python ./tests/create_outputs.py ./tests/resources/test-network/test-network.gpx ./tests/out
```

Test outputs are compared against known good reference files in 
[`tests/resources/test-network/reference-outputs/`](tests/resources/test-network/reference-outputs) by
comparing checksums on file contents using the [`tests/compare_outputs.py`](tests/compare_outputs.py) script.

```
$ poetry run python ./tests/compare_outputs.py ./tests/out
```

### Continuous Integration

All commits will trigger a Continuous Integration process using GitLab's CI/CD platform, configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## Deployment

The Air Unit Network utility is distributed as a Python package installed through Pip from the
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/bas-air-unit-network-dataset/) registry.

Source and binary packages are built and published automatically using
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) in [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment).

**Note:** Packages for non-tagged commits will use `0.0.0` as a version to indicate they're informal releases.

To build the Python package manually:

```
$ poetry build
```

To publish the Python package to PyPi manually, you will need an API token for the BAS organisational PyPi account,
set as the `POETRY_PYPI_TOKEN_PYPI` environment variable. Then run:

```
$ poetry publish --username british-antarctic-survey
```

### Continuous Deployment

All commits will trigger a Continuous Deployment process using GitLab's CI/CD platform, configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
