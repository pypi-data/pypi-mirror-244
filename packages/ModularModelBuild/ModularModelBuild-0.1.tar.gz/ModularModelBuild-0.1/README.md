# ModularModelBuild

ModularModelBuild is a Python module designed to create linear or nonlinear numerical models for volumetric modular steel buildings using the finite element method. It leverages the power of OpenSeesPy, a Python library for the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees).

## Features

- **Linear and Nonlinear Models**: Create both linear and nonlinear numerical models based on your specific requirements.
- **Volumetric Modular Steel Buildings**: Specifically designed for creating models of volumetric modular steel buildings.
- **Finite Element Method**: Uses the finite element method for creating numerical models, providing accurate and reliable results.
- **OpenSeesPy Integration**: Fully integrated with OpenSeesPy, allowing for advanced earthquake engineering simulations.

## Installation

You can install ModularModelBuild using pip:

```bash
pip install ModularModelBuild
```

## Usage
After installing the module, you can import it in your Python scripts as follows:

```python
import ModularModelBuild
```
