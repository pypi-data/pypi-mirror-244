# GCPMate - Google Cloud Platform Assistant

GCPMate is a tool that helps you manage your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources. It uses OpenAI's powerful language models to understand what you want to do, and then generates GCP command-line instructions for you to execute. If you like the proposed outcome, GCPMate can also execute the commands for you!

## Installation

To use GCPMate, you'll need to have Python 3.x and an OpenAI API key. To install GCPMate, simply run:

```bash
pip install gcpmate
```
In current version program expects to find API key in `env` variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can obtain the API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. Once ready, you can set up `env` variable by running:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Usage

GCPMate will use OpenAI's language models to understand your query, and then generate a series of GCP command-line instructions for you to execute. If you like the proposed outcome, GCPMate can also execute the commands for you! To use GCPMate, simply run:

```bash
gcpmate "<your query>"
```

Where `<your query>` is a description of what you want to achieve in GCP.

To get an explanation for a command, error or even a custom query, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcpmate --explain "your query"
```

Replace "your query" with the text you want to explain. Be sure to use single quotes if your query contains double quotes, and vice versa.

## Examples

Here are some example queries you can use with GCPMate:

```bash
gcpmate "create a new GCP project called my-superb-new-project"
```

```bash
gcpmate "create ubuntu VM called superbvm in us-central1-a in project <xyz>"
```

You can also use GCPMate to ask queries, or paste error messages, or ask to explain a command:

```bash
gcpmate --explain "Why I cannot connect to my VM over ssh?"
```

```bash
gcpmate -e " gcloud compute instances create newvm --project superproject324 --zone us-central1-a --image-family ubuntu-1804-lts --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud"
# this query will return explanation what that command would do.
```

## Options

GCPMate supports several command-line options:
```bash
gcpmate -h  # Show the help message and exit
gcpmate -m <model>  # Specify the OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-3.5-turbo)
gcpmate -s  # Skip printing "Fair warning" and runtime info (gcloud account, project, region, zone, OpenAI model)
gcpmate -e  # Return explanation to given query, which can be command, error message, etc.
```
