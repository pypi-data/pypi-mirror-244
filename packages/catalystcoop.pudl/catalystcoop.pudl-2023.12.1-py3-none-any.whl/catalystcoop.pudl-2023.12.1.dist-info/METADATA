What is PUDL?
-------------

The `PUDL <https://catalyst.coop/pudl/>`__ Project is an open source data processing
pipeline that makes US energy data easier to access and use programmatically.

Hundreds of gigabytes of valuable data are published by US government agencies, but
it's often difficult to work with. PUDL takes the original spreadsheets, CSV files,
and databases and turns them into a unified resource. This allows users to spend more
time on novel analysis and less time on data preparation.

What data is available?
-----------------------

PUDL currently integrates data from:

* `EIA Form 860 <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/>`__: 2001 - 2022
* `EIA Form 860m <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860m/>`__: 2023-06
* `EIA Form 861 <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/>`__: 2001 - 2022
* `EIA Form 923 <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/>`__: 2001 - 2023-08
* `EPA Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) <https://campd.epa.gov/>`__: 1995 - 2022
* `FERC Form 1 <https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/electric/general-information/electric-industry-forms/form-1-electric-utility-annual>`__: 1994-2021
* `FERC Form 714 <https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/electric/general-information/electric-industry-forms/form-no-714-annual-electric/data>`__: 2006-2020
* `US Census Demographic Profile 1 Geodatabase <https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2010/geo/tiger-data.html>`__: 2010

Thanks to support from the `Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Energy & Environment
Program <https://sloan.org/programs/research/energy-and-environment>`__, from
2021 to 2024 we will be integrating the following data as well:

* `EIA Form 176 <https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/TblDefs/NG_DataSources.html#s176>`__
  (The Annual Report of Natural Gas Supply and Disposition)
* `FERC Electric Quarterly Reports (EQR) <https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/electric/power-sales-and-markets/electric-quarterly-reports-eqr>`__
* `FERC Form 2 <https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural-gas/overview/general-information/natural-gas-industry-forms/form-22a-data>`__
  (Annual Report of Major Natural Gas Companies)
* `PHMSA Natural Gas Annual Report <https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/gas-distribution-gas-gathering-gas-transmission-hazardous-liquids>`__
* Machine Readable Specifications of State Clean Energy Standards

Who is PUDL for?
----------------

The project is focused on serving researchers, activists, journalists, policy makers,
and small businesses that might not otherwise be able to afford access to this data
from commercial sources and who may not have the time or expertise to do all the
data processing themselves from scratch.

We want to make this data accessible and easy to work with for as wide an audience as
possible: anyone from a grassroots youth climate organizers working with Google
sheets to university researchers with access to scalable cloud computing
resources and everyone in between!

How do I access the data?
-------------------------

There are several ways to access PUDL outputs. For more details you'll want
to check out `the complete documentation
<https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io>`__, but here's a quick overview:

Datasette
^^^^^^^^^
We publish a lot of the data on https://data.catalyst.coop using a tool called
`Datasette <https://datasette.io>`__ that lets us wrap our databases in a relatively
friendly web interface. You can browse and query the data, make simple charts and
maps, and download portions of the data as CSV files or JSON so you can work with it
locally. For a quick introduction to what you can do with the Datasette interface,
check out `this 17 minute video <https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/7/video/>`__.

This access mode is good for casual data explorers or anyone who just wants to grab a
small subset of the data. It also lets you share links to a particular subset of the
data and provides a REST API for querying the data from other applications.

Docker + Jupyter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Want access to all the published data in bulk? If you're familiar with Python
and `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`__ and are willing to install Docker you
can:

* `Download a PUDL data release <https://zenodo.org/record/3653158>`__ from
  CERN's `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__ archiving service.
* `Install Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`__
* Run the archived image using ``docker-compose up``
* Access the data via the resulting Jupyter Notebook server running on your machine.

If you'd rather work with the PUDL `SQLite <https://sqlite.org>`__ Databases and
`Apache Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org>`__ files directly, they are accessible
within the same Zenodo archive.

The `PUDL Examples repository <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples>`__
has more detailed instructions on how to work with the Zenodo data archive and Docker
image.

The PUDL Development Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're more familiar with the Python data science stack and are comfortable working
with git, ``conda`` environments, and the Unix command line, then you can set up the
whole PUDL Development Environment on your own computer. This will allow you to run the
full data processing pipeline yourself, tweak the underlying source code, and (we hope!)
make contributions back to the project.

This is by far the most involved way to access the data and isn't recommended for
most users. You should check out the `Development section <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/dev_setup.html>`__
of the main `PUDL documentation <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io>`__ for more
details.

Nightly Data Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are less concerned with reproducibility and want the freshest possible data
we automatically upload the outputs of our nightly builds to public S3 storage buckets
as part of the `AWS Open Data Registry
<https://registry.opendata.aws/catalyst-cooperative-pudl/>`__.  This data is based on
the `dev branch <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/tree/dev>`__, of PUDL, and
is updated most weekday mornings. It is also the data used to populate Datasette.

The nightly build outputs can be accessed using the AWS CLI, the S3 API, or downloaded
directly via the web. See `Accessing Nightly Builds <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_access.html#access-nightly-builds>`__
for links to the individual SQLite, JSON, and Apache Parquet outputs.
