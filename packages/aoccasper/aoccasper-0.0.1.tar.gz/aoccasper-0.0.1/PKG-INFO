# About

A way to solve AOC. Coded by Casper.

# How to use

Set the session cookies
~~~
from aoccasper import set_session_cookies
set_session_cookies("whatever your session cookies are for aoc")
~~~

If you don't do this, you will use a random aoc session's cookies which won't corespond to your own session cookies.

~~~
from aoccasper.day1 import part_1, part_2

# test_input = ...

part_1(test_input)
part_1()  # This will automatically pull your input based on the session_cookies that you have imported.
~~~
