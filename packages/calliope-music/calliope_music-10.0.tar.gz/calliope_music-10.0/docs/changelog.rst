Changelog
=========

10.0a1
------

  * The :class:`calliope.playlist.PlaylistItem` class replaces the older
    :class:`calliope.playlist.Item`. The old name is still available as an alias.
    The :class:`calliope.playlist.Playlist` type is now a usable ``list`` subclass
    instead of a ``typing.NewType`` subclass.
  * Replace 'splitstream' module with a pure-Python alternative, 'jsonlines'.
  * Show version number in `cpe --help`
  * The ``cpe lastfm histogram`` and ``cpe listenbrainz histogram`` commands
    now include field names as part of the JSON output.
    :mr:`223`
  * Improvements in the ``tracker`` module:
      * Use static, precompiled queries with parameters. This replaces string
        concatenation used previously. This protects against SPARQL injection
        and avoids re-compiling queries each time they are used.
      * Use full-text search in ``albums`` and ``tracks`` queries, which makes
        them significantly faster.
      * The ``search`` functionality can now match against album names.
  * Add :func:`calliope.cache.Cache.close()` method, which helps avoid
    SQLite locking issues and failures in ``test_cache.py``.

9.1
---

  * Fix bad code in new :func:`calliope.available_listen_history_providers()` function.

9.0
---

  * Stable interfaces across modules! The new :mod:`calliope.interface` module defines
    two interfaces, ListenHistoryProvider and ContentResolver. These are implemented each
    in two different modules. This makes it easier to use different backends in the same
    codebase.

    The ``special_mix`` example is updated to demonstrate how this works.
  * Context objects (BandcampContext, LastfmContext, etc.) now take
    configuration as keyword args. Some
    previously took a :class:`calliope.config.Configuration` object, which made it hard
    to override the config in applications.

    You can load the config yourself with the new
    :meth:`calliope.config.Configuration.get_section` method as needed.
  * There is a new policy for config key names in ``calliope.conf``: use underscores
    to separate words, e.g. ``client_id``. The previous (undocumented) policy was to
    use hyphens (e.g. ``client-id``).

    The :mod:`calliope.config` module will translate key names on load so that
    existing configs continue to work.
  * Python examples are now documented using Sphinx + AutoAPI, allowing you to read
    the docs online.
  * The ``special_mix`` example has some bug fixes and documentation improvements.
  * listenbrainz: The `listenbrainz-history tracks` command now uses
    ``artist_name + track_name`` to decide which listens refer to the same track.
    The code did use the ``recording_msid`` but this seems to change based on
    ``album_name``.
  * spotify: Content resolution now queries 20 candidates per item rather than 300.
  * cache: Fix a bug where v1 caches didn't properly migrate to v2.

8.2
---

  * The `lastfm` module has new documentation and bug fixes.
    :mr:`214`
  * Issues with Pip + Meson installs from sdist and Git repo are resolved.
    :mr:`213`

8.1
---

  * Examples are now included in the ``calliope_music`` distribution and
    installed as a separate ``calliope_examples`` package. The "Special Mix"
    example can now be executed directly after installation:

    .. code:: bash

        python3 -m calliope_examples.special_mix

  * Meson is now used as the project build system for Python package builds.
    All setuptools configuration has been removed. There should be no
    functional difference with this change.
    :mr:`211`

8.0
---

  * Multiple artists are now returned when you resolve or annotate via
    MusicBrainz and Spotify. This is a change in the data format for
    those subcommands: fields such as `artist_id` are replaced by a
    `artists` list.
    :mr:`205`
  * musicbrainz: The ``annotate --include`` option now supports all values that
    the `MusicBrainz API <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API#Subqueries>`_
    supports.

       * See the full list of keys with ``cpe musicbrainz list-includes``
       * Use ``*`` to select many keys, e.g. ``--include=artist.*`` to select
         all data related to the artist.

    :mr:`200`
  * Other Musicbrainz improvements:

       * The ``annotate`` command no longer calls ``search()`` unless required.
       * More detailed artist data is returned.
         :mr:`201`
       * Fix crash if :func:`calliope.musicbrainz.annotate` is called
         without the ``select_fn`` parameter.

    :mr:`203`
  * Fix some implementation gaps around
    :class:`calliope.cache.CacheLookupResult`.
    :mr:`199`
  * Remove unneccessary reimplementation of SQLite's retry-on-busy handling.
    :mr:`202`
  * Bugfixes:

       * cli: Quiet 'unhandled attribute' warnings from 'musicbrainzngs' library
           when `-v 3`.
           :mr:`199`
       * lastfm-history: Fix database error
           :mr:`208`
       * listenbrainz: Fix import error of bundled pylistenbrainz package (it's bundled awaiting https://github.com/metabrainz/pylistenbrainz/pull/10)
       * listenbrainz-history: Fix error when artist-msid isn't returned
           :mr:`207`
       * More stuff not listed here.

  * Cache expiry is now supported in `calliope.cache` module.
      * The :meth:`calliope.cache.Cache.lookup()` method now
        returns ``(datetime, value)`` instead of ``(bool, value)``.
        Code calling this function may require changes.
      * The :meth:`calliope.cache.Cache.wrap()` method now accepts
        an ``expiry`` parameter.
  * bandcamp: Add `export-band` and `export-album` commands.
    :mr:`192`
  * bandcamp: Add `wishlist` command.
  * example: Fix `collectors/online-to-local.sh`.
