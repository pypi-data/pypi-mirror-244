        Note that when dealing with rotationally-symmetric tesnors the roll
        angle can be ignored which allows an intuitively simpler in-plane and
        out-of-plane rotation to be performed. The cylindrical symmetry (Cinf)
        case is an example of this roll-invariance, and since it applies to
        collagen many sources just assume that the in-plane, out-of-plane
        notation is a general tensor property. It is not. Rotations in the
        general case must be performed using all three proper Euler rotation
        angles.

        function converts the delta and alpha anlges to omega and psi.
