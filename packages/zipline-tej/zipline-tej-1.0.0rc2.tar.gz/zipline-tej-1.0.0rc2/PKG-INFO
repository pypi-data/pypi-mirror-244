              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# Installation

## Used packages and environment
* Main package: Zipline
* Python 3.8 or above (currently support up to 3.11)
* Microsoft Windows OS or macOS or Linux
* Other Python dependency packages: Pandas, Numpy, Logbook, Exchange-calendars, etc.

## How to install Zipline Reloaded modified by TEJ

* We're going to illustrate under anaconda environment, so we suggest using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/data-science-platform) as development environment.

* Download dependency packages.

1. Windows [(zipline-tej.yml)](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/tejtw/zipline-tej/blob/main/zipline-tej.yml)

2. Mac [(zipline-tej_mac.yml)](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/tejtw/zipline-tej/blob/main/zipline-tej_mac.yml)

* Start an Anaconda (base) prompt, create an virtual environment and install the appropriate versions of packages:
(We **strongly** recommand using virtual environment to keep every project independent.) [(reason)](https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/software/virtualenv#definition)

```
Windows Users
# change directionary to the folder exists zipline-tej.yml
$ cd <C:\Users\username\Downloads>

# create virtual env
$ conda env create -f zipline-tej.yml

# activate virtual env
$ conda activate zipline-tej
Mac Users
# change directionary to the folder exists zipline-tej_mac.yml
$ cd <C:\Users\username\Downloads>

# create virtual env
$ conda env create -f zipline-tej_mac.yml

# activate virtual env
$ conda activate zipline-tej

```

Also, if you are familiar with Python enough, you can create a virtual environment without zipline-tej.yml and here's the sample :

```
# create virtual env
$ conda create -n <env_name> python=3.10

# activate virtual env
$ conda activate <env_name>

# download dependency packages
$ pip install zipline-tej

```

While encountering environment problems, we provided a consistent and stable environment on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

For users that using docker, we briefly introduce how to download and use it.

First of all, please download and install [docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

```

1. Start docker-desktop. (Registration is not must.)

2. Select the "images" on the leftside and search "tej87681088/tquant" and click "Pull".

3. After the image was downloaded, click the "run" icon the enter the optional settings.

3-1. Contaner-name: whatever you want.

3-2. Ports: the port to connect, "8888" is recommended.

3-3. Volumes: the place to store files. (You can create volume first on the left side.)

e.g. created a volume named "data", host path enter "data", container path "/app" is recommended.

4. Select the "Containers" leftside, the click the one which its image name is tej87681088/tquant

5. In its "Logs" would show an url like 
http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

6. Go to your browser and enter "http://127.0.0.1:<port_you_set_in_step_3-2>/tree?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

6-1. If your port is 8888, you can just click the hyperlink.

7. Start develop your strategy!

NOTICE: Next time, we just need to reproduce step4 to step6.
```

# Quick start

## CLI Interface

The following code implements a simple buy-and-hold trading algorithm.

```python
from zipline.api import order, record, symbol

def initialize(context):
    context.asset = symbol("2330")
    
def handle_data(context, data):
    order(context.asset, 10)
    record(TSMC=data.current(context.asset, "price"))
    
def analyze(context=None, results=None):
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Plot the portfolio and asset data.
    ax1 = plt.subplot(211)
    results.portfolio_value.plot(ax=ax1)
    ax1.set_ylabel("Portfolio value (TWD)")
    ax2 = plt.subplot(212, sharex=ax1)
    results.TSMC.plot(ax=ax2)
    ax2.set_ylabel("TSMC price (TWD)")

    # Show the plot.
    plt.gcf().set_size_inches(18, 8)
    plt.show()

```
You can then run this algorithm using the Zipline CLI. But first, you need to download some market data with historical prices and trading volumes:
* Before ingesting data, you have to set some environment variables as follow:
 
```
# setting TEJAPI_KEY to get permissions loading data
$ set TEJAPI_KEY=<your_key>
$ set TEJAPI_BASE=https://api.tej.com.tw

# setting download ticker
$ set ticker=2330 2317

# setting backtest period
$ set mdate=20200101 20220101

```
* Ingest and run backtesting algorithm

```
$ zipline ingest -b tquant
$ zipline run -f buy_and_hold.py  --start 20200101 --end 20220101 -o bah.pickle --no-benchmark --no-treasury 
```
Then, the resulting performance DataFrame is saved as bah.pickle, which you can load and analyze from Python.

### More useful zipline commands

Before calling **zipline** in CLI, be sure that TEJAPI_KEY and TEJAPI_BASE were set.
Use **zipline --help** to get more information.

For example :
We want to know how to use **zipline run**, we can run as follow:

```
zipline run --help
```

```

Usage: zipline run [OPTIONS]
  Run a backtest for the given algorithm.

Options:
  -f, --algofile FILENAME         The file that contains the algorithm to run.
  -t, --algotext TEXT             The algorithm script to run.
  -D, --define TEXT               Define a name to be bound in the namespace
                                  before executing the algotext. For example
                                  '-Dname=value'. The value may be any python
                                  expression. These are evaluated in order so

#### New add tickers

```
$ zipline add -t "<ticker_wants_to_add>"
```
If tickers are more than 1 ticker, split them apart by " " or ","  or ";".

For more detail use **zipline add --help** .

#### Display bundle-info
```
$ zipline bundle-info
```
To show what the tickers are there in newest bundle.

For more detail use **zipline bundle-info --help** .

#### Switch bundle

Before using switch, use **zipline bundles** to get the timestamp of each folder.

```
$ zipline switch -t "<The_timestamp_of_the_folder_want_to_use>"
```

Due to zipline only using the newest foler, switch can make previous folder become newest.

For more detail use **zipline switch --help** .

#### Update bundle

```
$ zipline update
```

To update the bundle information to newest date.

For more detail use **zipline update --help** .

## Jupyter Notebook 

### Change Anaconda kernel

* Since we've downloaded package "nb_conda_kernels", we should be able to change kernel in jupyter notebook.

#### How to new a notebook using specific kernel 

(1) Open anaconda prompt

(2) Enter the command as follow :
```
# First one can be ignore if already in environment of zipline-tej
$ conda activate zipline-tej 
# start a jupyter notebook
$ jupyter notebook 
```
(3) Start a notebook and select Python[conda env:zipline-tej]

(4)(Optional) If you have already written a notebook, you can open it and  change kernel by clicking the "Kernel" in menu and "Change kernel" to select the specfic kernel.


### Set environment variables TEJAPI_KEY, ticker and mdate

\* ticker would be your target ticker symbol, and it should be a string. If there're more than one ticker needed, use " ", "," or ";" to split them apart. 

\* mdate refers the begin date and end date, use " ", "," or ";" to split them apart.

```python
In[1]:
import os    
os.environ['TEJAPI_KEY'] = <your_key>    
os.environ['ticker'] ='2330 2317'     
os.environ['mdate'] ='20200101 20220101'  
```
### Call ingest to download data to ~\\\.zipline

```python
In[2]:    
!zipline ingest -b tquant
[Out]: 
Merging daily equity files:
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.ssssss] INFO: zipline.data.bundles.core: Ingesting tquant.
```


### Design the backtesting strategy

```python
In[3]:
from zipline.api import order, record, symbol

def initialize(context):
    context.asset = symbol("2330")
    
def handle_data(context, data):
    order(context.asset, 10)
    record(TSMC=data.current(context.asset, "price"))
    
def analyze(context=None, results=None):
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Plot the portfolio and asset data.
    ax1 = plt.subplot(211)
    results.portfolio_value.plot(ax=ax1)
    ax1.set_ylabel("Portfolio value (TWD)")
    ax2 = plt.subplot(212, sharex=ax1)
    results.TSMC.plot(ax=ax2)
    ax2.set_ylabel("TSMC price (TWD)")

    # Show the plot.
    plt.gcf().set_size_inches(18, 8)
    plt.show()
```
### Run backtesting algorithm and plot

```python
In[4]:
from zipline import run_algorithm
import pandas as pd
from zipline.utils.calendar_utils import get_calendar
trading_calendar = get_calendar('TEJ_XTAI')

start = pd.Timestamp('20200103', tz ='utc' )
end = pd.Timestamp('20211230', tz='utc')

result = run_algorithm(start=start,
                  end=end,
                  initialize=initialize,
                  capital_base=1000000,
                  handle_data=handle_data,
                  bundle='tquant',
                  trading_calendar=trading_calendar,
                  analyze=analyze,
                  data_frequency='daily'
                  )
[Out]:
```
