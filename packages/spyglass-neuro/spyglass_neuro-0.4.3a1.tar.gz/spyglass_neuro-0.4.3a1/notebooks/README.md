# Tutorial Notebooks

There are several paths one can take to these notebooks. The notebooks have
two-digits in their names, the first of which indicates it's 'batch', as
described in the categories below.

<!-- TODO: Add links when names are finalized. -->

## 0. Intro

Everyone should complete the Setup and Insert Data notebooks. Data Sync is an
optional additional tool for collaborators that want to share analysis files.
Merge Tables features details on a new table tier unique to Spyglass.

## 1. Electrophysiology

For folks running ephys analysis, one could use the either one or both of the
following...

1. Spike Sorting, and optionally the Curation notebooks
2. LFP, and optionally Theta notebooks

## 2. Position

For folks tracking animal position, use of either the Trodes or DLC (DeepLabCut)
notebooks depends on preferred tracking method. Either case should be followed
by Info and Linearization notebooks.

## 3. Combo

The remaining notebooks make use of both ephys and position data for further
processing.

- Ripple Detection: Uses LFP and Position information
- Extract Marks: Comparing actual and mental position using unclustered spikes
    and spike waveform features.
- Decoding: Uses either spike sorted of clusterless ephys analysis to look at
    mental position.

## Developer note

The `py_scripts` directory contains the same notebook data in `.py` form to
facilitate GitHub PR reviews. To update them, run the following from the root
Spyglass directory

```bash
pip install jupytext
jupytext --to py notebooks/*ipynb
mv notebooks/*py notebooks/py_scripts
black .
```

Unfortunately, jupytext-generated py script are not black-compliant by default.
