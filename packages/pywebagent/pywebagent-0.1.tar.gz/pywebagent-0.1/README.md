## Description

`pywebagent` is an <b>experimental</b> Python package designed to control websites by utilizing the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision.  
It basically converts website capabilities to python functions!
With `pywebagent`, you can automate complex tasks on websites, like filling forms, buying products, and more.  
It is especially useful for performing tasks that require multiple steps, such as buying a product online, booking a flight, etc.

## Highlights

üëÅÔ∏è Web navigation using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision technology  
üìù Fill in forms  
üí≥ Buy products  
üìÅ Upload Files

## Installation

Ensure you have Python version 3.6 or later installed. Then run this command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install pywebagent
```

## Usage

### Example 1: Order a plush bunny on Amazon
```python
from pywebagent import act

# sometimes you'll need to help the agent bypass the captcha, sometimes it will succeed by itself
act(
    "https://amazon.com", 
    "Order a plush bunny", 
    email="<your amazon email>", 
    password="<your amazon password>"
)
```


### Example 2: Order your photo prints from Mixtiles
Here is an example of how to use `pywebagent` to print some images on [mixtiles.com:](https://mixtiles.com/)

```python
act(
    "https://mixtiles.com/",
    "Order these as Mixtiles",
    name="John Doe",
    email="johndoe208909@gmail.com",
    photos=[
        "omnnitool/demo/mixtiles/1.jpg",
        "omnnitool/demo/mixtiles/2.jpg",
        "omnnitool/demo/mixtiles/3.jpg"
    ],
    payment_info={
        "card_number": "4242424242424242",
        "expiry_date": "12/22",
        "cvc": "123"
    },
    address="123 Main St, San Francisco, CA 94105"
)
```

<b>Note: OPENAI_API_KEY should be set as an environment variable.</b>

## Upcoming Features
* Add return values from `act` (e.g, order number of purchase, ...)
* Add support for more types of interaction (including scrolling, swiping, ..)
* Add caching to speed everything up
* Support open source vision models
* Support more complicated actions

## How It Works
The concept is extremely simple. Detect all elements that have an event handler (which means they can be interacted with), highlight them, take a screenshot, and ask GPT 4 Vision what to do. The results are surprisingly good.
