# A simple DSL for creating spaCy pattern matchers
Inspired by [lrparsing](https://pypi.org/project/lrparsing/).

Pros:
- Simple.
- No dependencies.
- DSL is integrated to Python.

Cons:
- Untested.
- Unoptimized.

For more details, read the example (`examples/example.py`) and the documentation (*source code, actually*).
